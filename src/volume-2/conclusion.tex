\markboth{Conclusion}{Conclusion}

Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct.
The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making traditional prosecutorial judgment.
At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.
Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.
Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.
