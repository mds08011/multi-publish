\subsection{Introductory Note}

The President provided written responses through his personal counsel to questions submitted to him by the Special Counsel's Office. We first explain the process that led to the submission of written questions and then attach the President's responses.

Beginning in December 2017, this Office sought for more than a year to interview the President on topics relevant to both Russian-election interference and obstruction-of-justice.
We advised counsel that the President was a ``subject'' of the investigation under the definition of the Justice Manual---``a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation.''
Justice Manual \S~9-11.151~(2018).
We also advised counsel that ``[a]n interview with the President is vital to our investigation'' and that this Office had ``carefully considered the constitutional and other arguments raised by \dots\ counsel, and they d[id] not provide us with reason to forgo seeking an interview.''% 1
\footnote{5/16/18 Letter, Special Counsel to the President's Personal Counsel, at~1.}
We additionally stated that ``it is in the interest of the Presidency and the public for an interview to take place'' and offered ``numerous accommodations to aid the President's preparation and avoid surprise.''% 2
\footnote{5/16/18 Letter, Special Counsel[]'s Office to the President's Personal Counsel, at~1;
\textit{see} 7/30/18 Letter, Special Counsel's Office to the President's Personal Counsel, at~1 (describing accommodations).}
After extensive discussions with the Department of Justice about the Special Counsel's objective of securing the President's testimony, these accommodations included the submissions of written questions to the President on certain Russia-related topics.% 3
\footnote{9/17/18 Letter, Special Counsel's Office to the President's Personal Counsel, at~1 (submitting written questions).}

We received the President's written responses in late November 2018.% 4
\footnote{11/20/18 Letter, President's Personal Counsel to the Special Counsel's Office (transmitting written responses of Donald J. Trump).}
In December 2018, we informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respects.% 5
\footnote{12/3/18 Letter, Special Counsel's Office to the President's Personal Counsel, at~3.}
We noted, among other things, that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he ``does not `recall' or `remember' or have an `independent recollection'\thinspace'' of information called for by the questions.% 6
\footnote{12/3/18 Letter, Special Counsel's Office to the President's Personal Counsel, at~3.}
Other answers were ``incomplete or imprecise.''% 7
\footnote{12/3/18 Letter, Special Counsel's Office to the President's Personal Counsel, at~3 [] (noting, ``for example,'' that the President ``did not answer whether he had at any time directed or suggested that discussions about the Trump Moscow Project should cease \dots\ but he has since made public comments about that topic'').}
The written responses, we informed counsel, ``demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask follow-up questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client's recollection or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection.''% 8
\footnote{12/3/18 Letter, Special Counsel's Office to the President's Personal Counsel, at~3.}
We again requested an in-person interview, limited to certain topics, advising the President's counsel that ``[t]his is the President's opportunity to voluntarily provide us with information for us to evaluate in the context of all of the evidence we have gathered.''% 9
\footnote{12/3/18 Letter, Special Counsel to the President's Personal Counsel.}
The President declined.% 10
\footnote{12/12/18 Letter, President's Personal Counsel to the Special Counsel's Office, at~2.}

\blackout{Grand Jury}% 12
\footnote{\blackout{Grand Jury}}

Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to issue a subpoena for his testimony.
We viewed the written answers to be inadequate.
But at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report.
We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report.
As explained in \hyperlink{subsection.2.2.2}{Volume~II, Section~II.B}, we determined that the substantial quantity of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation.

\paragraph*{Response to Question I, Parts (a) through (c)}

I have no recollection of learning at the time that Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner was considering participating in a meeting in June 2016 concerning potentially negative information about Hillary Clinton.
Nor do I recall learning during the campaign that the June~9, 2016 meeting had taken place, that the referenced emails existed, or that Donald J. Trump, Jr., had other communications with Emin Agalarov or Robert Goldstone between June~3, 2016 and June~9, 2016.

\paragraph*{Response to Question I, Part (d)}

I have no independent recollection of what portion of these four days in June of 2016 I spent in Trump Tower.
This was one of many busy months during a fast-paced campaign, as the primary season was ending and we were preparing for the general election campaign.

I am now aware that my Campaign's calendar indicates that I was in New York City from June~6--9, 2016.
Calendars kept in my Trump Tower office reflect that I had various calls and meetings scheduled for each of these days.
While those calls and meetings may or may not actually have taken place, they do indicate that I was in Trump Tower during a portion of each of these working days, and I have no reason to doubt that I was.
When I was in New York City, I stayed at my Trump Tower apartment.

My Trump Organization desk calendar also reflects that I was outside Trump Tower during portions of these days.
The June~7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave Trump Tower in the early evening for Westchester where I gave remarks after winning the California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries held that day.
The June~8, 2016 calendar indicates a scheduled departure in late afternoon to attend a ceremony at my son's school.
The June~9, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to attend midday meetings and a fund raising luncheon at the Four Seasons Hotel.
At this point, I do not remember on what dates these events occurred, but I do not currently have a reason to doubt that they took place as scheduled on my calendar.

Widely available media reports, including television footage, also shed light on my activities during these days.
For example, I am aware that my June~7, 2016 victory remarks at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, New York, were recorded and published by the media.
I remember winning those primaries and generally recall delivering remarks that evening.

At this point in time, I do not remember whether I spoke or met with Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner on June~9, 2016.
My desk calendar indicates I was scheduled to meet with Paul Manafort on the morning of June~9, but I do not recall if that meeting took place.
It was more than two years ago, at a time when I had many calls and interactions daily.

\paragraph*{Response to Question I, Part (e)}

I have no independent recollection of any communications I had with the Agalarov family or anyone I understood to be a representative of the Agalarov family after June~3, 2016 and before the end of the campaign.
While preparing to respond to these questions, I have become aware of written communications with the Agalarovs during the campaign that were sent, received, and largely authored by my staff and which I understand have already been produced to you.

In general, the documents include congratulatory letters on my campaign victories, emails about a painting Emin and Aras Agalarov arranged to have delivered to Trump Tower as a birthday present, and emails regarding delivery of a book written by Aras Agalarov.
The documents reflect that the deliveries were screened by the Secret Service.

\paragraph*{Response to Question I, Part (f)}

I do not recall being aware during the campaign of communications between Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner and any member or representative of the Agalarov family, Robert Goldstone, Natalia Veselnitskaya (whose name I was not familiar with), or anyone I understood to be a Russian official.

\paragraph*{Response to Question I, Part (g)}

In remarks I delivered the night I won the California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries, I said, ``I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.''
In general, I expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available, negative information about the Clintons, including, for example, Mrs.~Clinton's failed policies, the Clintons' use of the State Department to further their interests and the interests of the Clinton Foundation, Mrs.~Clinton's improper use of a private server for State Department business, the destruction of 33,000 emails on that server, and Mrs.~Clinton's temperamental unsuitability for the office of President.

In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the Campaign documents already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution, and sources of information for the speech I expected to give ``probably'' on the Monday following my June~7, 2016 comments.
These documents generally show that the text of the speech was initially drafted by Campaign staff with input from various outside advisors and was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the book \textit{Clinton Cash} by Peter Schweizer.

The Pulse Nightclub terrorist attack took place in the early morning hours of Sunday, June~12, 2016.
In light of that tragedy, I gave a speech directed more specifically to national security and terrorism than to the Clintons.
That speech was delivered at the Saint Anselm College Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire, and, as reported, opened with the following:

\begin{quote}
This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.
Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.
There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.
But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.
\end{quote}

I continued to speak about Mrs.~Clinton's failings throughout the campaign, using the information prepared for inclusion in the speech to which I referred on June~7, 2016.

\paragraph*{Response to Question I, Part (h)}

I have no recollection of being told during the campaign that Vladimir Putin or the Russian government ``supported'' my candidacy or ``opposed'' the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.
However, I was aware of some reports indicating that President Putin had made complimentary statements about me.

\paragraph*{Response to Question I, Part (i)}

I have no recollection of being told during the campaign that any foreign government or foreign leader had provided, wished to provide, or offered to provide tangible support to my campaign.

I do not recall being provided any information during the campaign about the hacking of any of the named entities or individuals before it became the subject of media reporting.

\paragraph*{Response to Question II, Part (b)}

I recall that in the months leading up to the election there was considerable media reporting about the possible hacking and release of campaign-related information and there was a lot of talk about this matter.

I do not recall being aware during the campaign of any communications between the individuals named in Question II~(c) and anyone I understood to be a representative of WikiLeaks or any of the other individuals or entities referred to in the question.

\paragraph*{Response to Question II, Part (d)}

I made the statement quoted in Question II~(d) in jest and sarcastically, as was apparent to any objective observer.
The context of the statement is evident in the full reading or viewing of the July~27, 2016 press conference, and I refer you to the publicly available transcript and video of that press conference.
I do not recall having any discussion about the substance of the statement in advance of the press conference.
I do not recall being told during the campaign of any efforts by Russia to infiltrate or hack the computer systems or email accounts of Hillary Clinton or her campaign prior to them becoming the subject of media reporting and I have no recollection of any particular conversation in that regard.

By whom?
What were you told about the project?

\paragraph*{Response to Question III, Parts (a) through (g)}

Sometime in 2015, Michael Cohen suggested to me the possibility of a Trump Organization project in Moscow.
As I recall, Mr.~Cohen described this as a proposed project of a general type we have done in the past in a variety of locations.
I signed the non-binding Letter of Intent attached to your questions as Exhibit~B which required no equity or expenditure on our end and was consistent with our ongoing efforts to expand into significant markets around the world.

I had few conversations with Mr.~Cohen on this subject.
As I recall, they were brief, and they were not memorable.
I was not enthused about the proposal, and I do not recall any discussion of travel to Russia in connection with it.
I do not remember discussing it with anyone else at the Trump Organization, although it is possible.
I do not recall being aware at the time of any communications between Mr.~Cohen or Felix Sater and any Russian government official regarding the Letter of Intent.
In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that Mr.~Cohen sent an email regarding the Letter of Intent to ``Mr.~Peskov'' at a general, public email account, which should show there was no meaningful relationship with people in power in Russia.
I understand those documents already have been provided to you.

I vaguely remember press inquiries and media reporting during the campaign about whether the Trump Organization had business dealings in Russia.
I may have spoken with campaign staff or Trump Organization employees regarding responses to requests for information, but I have no current recollection of any particular conversation, with whom I may have spoken, when, or the substance of any conversation.

\begin{enumerate}[i.]

\item What consideration did you give to lifting sanctions and/or recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea if you were elected?
Describe who you spoke with about this topic, when, the substance of the discussion(s).

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Response to Question IV, Parts (a) through (d)}

Mr.~Manafort was hired primarily because of his delegate work for prior presidential candidates, including Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bob Dole.

I had no knowledge of Mr.~Manafort offering briefings on the progress of my campaign to an individual named Oleg Deripaska, nor do I remember being aware of Mr.~Manafort or anyone else associated with my campaign sending or directing others to send internal Trump Campaign information to anyone I knew to be in Ukraine or Russia at the time or to anyone I understood to be a Ukrainian or Russian government employee or official.
I do not remember Mr.~Manafort communicating to me any particular positions Ukraine or Russia would want the United States to support.

\paragraph*{Response to Question IV, Part (e)}

I do not recall being told during the campaign of efforts by Russian officials to meet with me or with senior members of my campaign.

The documents show that Ms.~Graff prepared for my signature a brief response declining the invitation.
I understand these documents already have been produced to you.
