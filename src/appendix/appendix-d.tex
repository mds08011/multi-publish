This appendix identifies matters transferred or referred by the Special Counsel's Office, as well as cases prosecuted by the Office that are now completed.

\subsection{Transfers}

The Special Counsel's Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.
Certain matters assigned to the Office by the Acting Attorney General have not fully concluded as of the date of this report.
After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office has transferred responsibility for those matters to other components of the Department of Justice and the~FBI\null.
Those transfers include:

\begin{enumerate}[1.]

\item \myuline{United States~v.\ Bijan Rafiekian and Kamil Ekim Alptekin}

\textit{U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia}\hfil\break
(Awaiting trial)

The Acting Attorney General authorized the Special Counsel to investigate, among other things, possible criminal conduct by Michael Flynn in acting as an unregistered agent for the Government of Turkey.
\textit{See} August~2, 2017 Memorandum from Rod J. Rosenstein to Robert S. Mueller,~III\null.
The Acting Attorney General later confirmed the Special Counsel's authority to investigate Rafiekian and Alptekin because they ``may have been jointly involved'' with Flynn in FARA-related crimes.
\textit{See} October~20, 2017 Memorandum from Associate Deputy Attorney General Scott Schools to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.

On December~1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to an Information charging him with making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
As part of that plea, Flynn agreed to a Statement of the Offense in which he acknowledged that the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) documents he filed on March~7, 2017 ``contained materially false statements and omissions.''
Flynn's plea occurred before the Special Counsel had made a final decision on whether to charge Rafiekian or Alptekin.
On March~27, 2018, after consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Special Counsel's Office referred the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin to the National Security Division (NSD) for any action it deemed appropriate.
The Special Counsel's Office determined the referral was appropriate because the investigation of Flynn had been completed, and that investigation had provided the rationale for the Office's investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin.
At NSD's request, the Eastern District of Virginia continued the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin.
