<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 600.8(c), which
states that, ”[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel&#x2019;s work, he … shall provide the
Attorney General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions
[the Special Counsel] reached.”
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and
systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in
mid-2016. In June, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team
publicly announced that Russian hackers had compromised its computer network.
Releases of hacked materials—hacks that public reporting soon attributed to the
Russian government—began that same month. Additional releases followed in
July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in October and
November.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks&#x2019;s first release of stolen documents, a
foreign government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump
Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested
to a representative of that foreign government that the Trump Campaign had
received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign
through the anonymous release of information damaging to Democratic presidential
candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016,
to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference
activities.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government ”directed
recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political
organizations,” and, ”[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US
election process.” After the election, in late December 2016, the United States
imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election. By early 2017,
several congressional committees were examining Russia&#x2019;s interference in the
election.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   Within the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017
appointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the
Special Counsel authorized him to investigate ”the Russian government&#x2019;s efforts to
interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” including any links or coordination
between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation established that
Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First,
a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a
Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against
entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then
released stolen documents. The investigation also identified numerous links between
the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although the investigation
established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it
would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian
efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign
conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference
activities.

<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   Below we describe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements about the
results of our investigation and the Special Counsel&#x2019;s charging decisions, and we then
provide an overview of the two volumes of our report.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office found to be
supported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report
points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or
event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office
to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation
established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation
did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those
facts.
</p><!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals
constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of
”collusion.” In so doing, the Office recognized that the word ”collud[e]” was used in
communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the
investigation&#x2019;s scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting
about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in
the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons,
the Office&#x2019;s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as
defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question
whether members of the Trump Campaign ”coordinat[ed]”—a term that appears in the
appointment order—with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion,
”coordination” does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood
coordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more
than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the
other&#x2019;s actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when
stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump
Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference
activities.

<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference
operations identified by the investigation—a social media campaign designed
to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States. The
IRA was based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and received funding from Russian
oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he controlled. Prigozhin is widely
reported to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________</span>

</p><!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S.
political system through what it termed ”information warfare.” The campaign evolved from
a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system,
to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged
candidate Clinton. The IRA&#x2019;s operation also included the purchase of political
advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the
staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees
posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and
Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify
evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section
II of this report details the Office&#x2019;s investigation of the Russian social media
campaign.

 id="x1-5000"></a>Russian Hacking Operations</h4>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in
early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign.
The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General
Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations.
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign
volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the
GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole
hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks.
Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government&#x2019;s role
in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the
fictitious online personas ”DCLeaks” and ”Guccifer 2.0.” The GRU later released
additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   The presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (”Trump Campaign” or ”Campaign”)
showed interest in WikiLeaks&#x2019;s releases of documents and welcomed their potential to

 id="x1-6000"></a>Russian Contacts with the Campaign</h4>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of
contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian
government. The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the
Campaign conspiring or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities.
Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would
benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the
Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released
through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump
Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election
interference activities.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for
Campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy
positions seeking improved U.S.–Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the
contacts between Russia and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and
transition periods, the most salient of which are summarized below in chronological
order.
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">2015</span>. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump
Organization real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate
Trump signed a Letter of Intent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015,
and in January 2016 Trump Organization executive Michael Cohen emailed and
spoke about the project with the office of Russian government press secretary
Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through at least
June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate
Trump.
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Spring 2016</span>. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early
contact with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and
traveled to Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip,
Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Russian government had ”dirt” on Hillary Clinton in
the form of thousands of emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016,
Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump
Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could
assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging
to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months
thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a
meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took
place.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Summer 2016</span>. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer
of 2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for
President. On June 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump
Campaign officials Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul
Manafort to deliver what the email proposing the meeting had described as ”official
documents and information that would incriminate Hillary.” The materials were offered to
Trump Jr. as ”part of Russia and its government&#x2019;s support for Mr. Trump.”
The written communications setting up the meeting showed that the Campaign
anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist candidate Trump&#x2019;s
electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer&#x2019;s presentation did not provide such
information.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and
the DNC announced that Russian government hackers had infiltrated the DNC
and obtained access to opposition research on candidate Trump, among other
documents.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
capacity to Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School. Page had
lived and worked in Russia between 2003 and 2007. After returning to the United States,
Page became acquainted with at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was
later charged in 2015 with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia. Page&#x2019;s July
2016 trip to Moscow and his advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention.
The Campaign then distanced itself from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him
from the Campaign.
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from
the DNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents
revealing information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public
reporting that U.S. intelligence agencies had ”high confidence” that the Russian
government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC. And
within a week of the release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its
May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian
government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign
government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination
between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign.
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   Separately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New
York City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses
to have ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a
peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office
was a ”backdoor” way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men
believed the plan would require candidate Trump&#x2019;s assent to succeed (were he to be
elected President). They also discussed the status of the Trump Campaign and
Manafort&#x2019;s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states. Months
before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with
Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August
meeting.
</p><!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Fall 2016</span>. On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking
in graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his
candidacy. Less than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of
John Podesta&#x2019;s emails that had been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016. The
FBI and other U.S. government institutions were at the time continuing their
investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere in the presidential
election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement ”that
the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US
persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.” Those ”thefts”
and the ”disclosures” of the hacked materials through online platforms such as
WikiLeaks, the statement continued, ”are intended to interfere with the US election
process.”
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Post-2016 Election</span>. Immediately after the November 8 election, Russian government
officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new
administration. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts.
The Russian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the
President-Elect and to arrange a call with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen
picked up the effort from there.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >   Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia&#x2019;s sovereign wealth fund, was among
the Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early
December, a business associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump
Campaign and an associate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince
later met face-to-face in January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.–Russia
relations. During the same period, another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a
friend of Jared Kushner who had not served on the Campaign or the Transition Team.
Dmitriev and Kushner&#x2019;s friend collaborated on a short written reconciliation
plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been cleared
through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration,
and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson.
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   On December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having
interfered in the election. Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian
Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response
to the sanctions. The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not
take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later,
President-Elect Trump tweeted, ”Great move on delay (by V. Putin).” The next day, on
December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him the request had been received at
the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result of Flynn&#x2019;s
request.

</p><!--l. 110--><hr width="10%"></div>
<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   On January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect
Trump on a joint assessment—drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence
Agency, FBI, and National Security Agency—that concluded with high confidence that
Russia had intervened in the election through a variety of means to assist Trump&#x2019;s
candidacy and harm Clinton&#x2019;s. A declassified version of the assessment was publicly
released that same day.
</p><!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees—the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
on Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)—announced that they
would conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian
interference in the election. Then-FBI Director James Comey later confirmed to Congress
the existence of the FBI&#x2019;s investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the
election. On March 20, 2017, in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey
stated:
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >
      </p><div class="quote">
      <!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that
      the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the
      Russian government&#x2019;s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,
      and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals
      associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and
      whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia&#x2019;s
      efforts.  … As  with  any  counterintelligence  investigation,  this  will  also
      include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.</p></div>
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   The investigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks until
May 9, 2017, when President Trump fired Comey as FBI Director—an action which is
analyzed in Volume II of the report.
</p><!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special
Counsel and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his
congressional testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any
other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 600.4(a), which generally covers efforts to
interfere with or obstruct the investigation.
</p><!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   President Trump reacted negatively to the Special Counsel&#x2019;s appointment. He told
advisors that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson
(Jeff) Sessions unrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel
removed, and engaged in efforts to curtail the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation and prevent
the disclosure of evidence to it, including through public and private contacts with
potential witnesses. Those and related actions are described and analyzed in Volume II of
the report.

 id="x1-7000"></a>The Special Counsel&#x2019;s Charging Decisions</h4>
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >In reaching the charging decisions described in Volume I of the report, the Office
determined whether the conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law
chargeable under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 9-27.000 et
seq. (2018). The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct
constitutes a crime; if so, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to
obtain and sustain a conviction; and whether prosecution would serve a substantial federal
interest that could not be adequately served by prosecution elsewhere or through
non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 9-27.220.
</p><!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office&#x2019;s charging decisions,
which contain three main components.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   First, the Office determined that Russia&#x2019;s two principal interference operations in the
2016 U.S. presidential election—the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping
operations—violated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the
social media campaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to
defraud the United States by undermining through deceptive acts the work of
federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influence in U.S. elections, as
well as related counts of identity theft. See <span 
class="cmti-12">United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> Internet Research</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Agency, et al.</span>, No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers
who carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal
email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to
violate, among other federal laws, the federal computer-intrusion statute, and
they have been so charged. <span 
class="cmti-12">See United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> Netyksho, et al.</span>, No. 18-cr-215
(D.D.C.).

<span class="redacted">______ ______ ___ _______ ___________ ___________ _____ ___ ___ ________ _______ __________ ___</span>
<span class="redacted">______ __ _______ _______ _______</span>.
</p><!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties
to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the
evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the
evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered
agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence
about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks&#x2019;s releases of hacked materials
was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the
evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign
conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016
election.
</p><!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the
Trump Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the
investigation of Russian election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as
violations of the federal false-statements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael
Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak
during the transition period. George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the
campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about, inter alia, the nature and
timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the professor who told Papadopoulos that
the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.
Former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false
statements to Congress about the Trump Moscow project. <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________</span>
<span class="redacted">________ _______ ______ ______ ___ _______ ___________ ___________ _____ ___ ___ ________</span>
<span class="redacted">_______ __________ ___ ______ __ _______ _______ _______</span>. And in February 2019, the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that Manafort lied to the
Office and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with
Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for
Ukraine.
</p>
<div class="center" 
>
<!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 166--><hr width="10%"></div>
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve
potential Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that
interactions between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at
the candidate&#x2019;s April 2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week
of the Republican National Convention were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the
investigation did not establish that one Campaign official&#x2019;s efforts to dilute a
portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were
undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also did not
establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at
Sessions&#x2019;s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential
campaign.
</p><!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >   The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a
complete picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some
individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and
were not, in the Office&#x2019;s judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The
Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information—such as information known to
attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media—in light of internal
Department of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span> 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the
information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or ”taint”) team. Even when
individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that
was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above.
And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as
well—numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the
United States.
</p><!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >   Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose
conduct we investigated—including some associated with the Trump Campaign—deleted
relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications
that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or
communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness
statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully
question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known
facts.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office
believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified
gaps, the Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information
would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the
report.

</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   The Acting Attorney General further clarified the scope of the Special Counsel&#x2019;s
investigatory authority in two subsequent memoranda. A memorandum dated August 2,
2017, explained that the Appointment Order had been ”worded categorically in order to
permit its public release without confirming specific investigations involving specific
individuals.” It then confirmed that the Special Counsel had been authorized since his
appointment to investigate allegations that three Trump campaign officials—Carter Page,
Paul Manafort, and George Papadopoulos—”committed a crime or crimes by
colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government&#x2019;s
efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.” The memorandum also
confirmed the Special Counsel&#x2019;s authority to investigate certain other matters,
including two additional sets of allegations involving Manafort (crimes arising from
payments he received from the Ukrainian government and crimes arising from his
receipt of loans from a bank whose CEO was then seeking a position in the Trump
Administration); allegations that Papadopoulos committed a crime or crimes
by acting as an unregistered agent of the Israeli government; and four sets of
allegations involving Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor to President
Trump.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   On October 20, 2017, the Acting Attorney General confirmed in a memorandum the
Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigative authority as to several individuals and entities.
First, ”as part of a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government&#x2019;s
efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” the Special Counsel was
authorized to investigate ”the pertinent activities of Michael Cohen, Richard
Gates,<span class="redacted">____</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  _  _  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">_ ___</span>  _  _  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span> , Roger Stone, and<span class="redacted">____</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  _  _  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">_ ___</span>  _  _  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span>  <span class="redacted">__</span> ” ”Confirmation of
the authorization to investigate such individuals,” the memorandum stressed,
”does not suggest that the Special Counsel has made a determination that any
of them has committed a crime.” Second, with respect to Michael Cohen, the
memorandum recognized the Special Counsel&#x2019;s authority to investigate ”leads relate[d]
to Cohen&#x2019;s establishment and use of Essential Consultants LLC to, inter alia,
receive funds from Russian-backed entities.” Third, the memorandum memorialized
the Special Counsel&#x2019;s authority to investigate individuals and entities who were
possibly engaged in ”jointly undertaken activity” with existing subjects of the
investigation, including Paul Manafort. Finally, the memorandum described an FBI
investigation opened before the Special Counsel&#x2019;s appointment into ”allegations
that [then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions] made false statements to the United
States Senate[,]” and confirmed the Special Counsel&#x2019;s authority to investigate that
matter.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   The Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority ”to
exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.”
28 C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 600.6. Like a U.S. Attorney&#x2019;s Office, the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office considered a
range of classified and unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the
Office&#x2019;s Russia investigation, and the Office structured that work around evidence for
possible use in prosecutions of federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
identified that warranted prosecution). There was substantial evidence immediately
available to the Special Counsel at the inception of the investigation in May 2017 because
the FBI had, by that time, already investigated Russian election interference for
nearly 10 months. The Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office exercised its judgment regarding
what to investigate and did not, for instance, investigate every public report of a
contact between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals and
entities.
</p><!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   The Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the
Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain
proceedings associated with the Office&#x2019;s work remain ongoing. After consultation with the
Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office has transferred responsibility for those
remaining issues to other components of the Department of Justice and FBI. Appendix D
lists those transfers.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   Two district courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel&#x2019;s authority to
investigate Russia election interference and links and/or coordination with the
Trump Campaign. See United States v. Manafort, 312 F. Supp. 3d 60, 79–83
(D.D.C. 2018); United States v. Manafort, 321 F. Supp. 3d 640, 650–655 (E.D.
Va. 2018). In the course of conducting that investigation, the Office periodically
identified evidence of potential criminal activity that was outside the scope of the
Special Counsel&#x2019;s authority established by the Acting Attorney General. After
consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office referred that
evidence to appropriate law enforcement authorities, principally other components
of the Department of Justice and to the FBI. Appendix D summarizes those
referrals.

Special Counsel assembled a team that at its high point included 19 attorneys—five of

Department lawyers and FBI personnel who screened materials obtained via court process

administrative staff of nine responsible for budget, finance, purchasing, human resources,

intelligence and counterintelligence information relevant to the FBI&#x2019;s broader national
security mission. FBI personnel who assisted the Office established procedures to identify

the Office regularly for that purpose for most of the Office&#x2019;s tenure. For more than the past
year, the FBI also embedded personnel at the Office who did not work on the Special

and to send—in writing—summaries of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence
information to FBI HQ and FBI Field Offices. Those communications and other
correspondence between the Office and the FBI contain information derived from the
investigation, not all of which is contained in this Volume. This Volume is a summary. It

Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and companies he controlled, including
Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering (collectively
”Concord”).<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   The IRA and its employees began operations targeting the United States as early as
2014. Using fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and
group pages designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and accounts, which
addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S.
activists. Over time, these social media accounts became a means to reach large
U.S. audiences. IRA employees travelled to the United States in mid-2014 on an
intelligence-gathering mission to obtain information and photographs for use in their social
media posts.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   IRA employees posted derogatory information about a number of candidates in the
2016 U.S. presidential election. By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting
the Trump Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA made various
expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on
social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S.
persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated electronically
with individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political
activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the staging of political
rallies.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

intentionally coordinated with the IRA&#x2019;s interference operation.
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   By the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S.
persons through their social media accounts. Multiple IRA-controlled Facebook groups and
Instagram accounts had hundreds of thousands of U.S. participants. IRA-controlled
Twitter accounts separately had tens of thousands of followers, including multiple U.S.
political figures who retweeted IRA-created content. In November 2017, a Facebook
representative testified that Facebook had identified 470 IRA-controlled Facebook accounts
that collectively made 80,000 posts between January 2015 and August 2017. Facebook
estimated the IRA reached as many as 126 million persons through its Facebook
accounts.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

By early 2015, the IRA began to create larger social media groups or public
social media pages that claimed (falsely) to be affiliated with U.S. political

mimicked real U.S. organizations. For example, one IRA-controlled Twitter
account, TEN_GOP, purported to be connected to the Tennessee Republican
Party.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Party activists, Black Lives Matter protesters, and other U.S. social and political
activists.

In August 2016, GRU officers targeted employees of <span class="redacted">____________ ___________</span>, a voting
technology company that developed software used by numerous U.S. counties to
manage voter rolls, and installed malware on the company network. Similarly, in
November 2016, the GRU sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts
used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S.
election.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The spearphishing emails contained an attached Word document coded with malicious
software (commonly referred to as a Trojan) that permitted the GRU to access the infected
computer.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The FBI was separately responsible for this investigation. We understand the FBI believes
that this operation enabled the GRU to gain access to the network of at least one Florida
county government. The Office did not independently verify that belief and, as explained
above, did not undertake the investigative steps that would have been necessary to do
so.

any of those services had gotten to the server. The proposal noted, ”Even if a

has connections with its government (Volume I, Section IV.A.4); a meeting at
Trump Tower between the Campaign and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on
candidate Clinton that was ”part of Russia and its government&#x2019;s support for [Trump]”

Section IV.A.6); post-Convention contacts between Trump Campaign officials

completed a letter of intent (LOI) for a Trump Moscow property. The LOI, signed by

According to Cohen, Trump indicated a willingness to travel if it would assist the project
significantly. On one occasion, Trump told Cohen to speak with then-campaign manager
Corey Lewandowski to coordinate the candidate&#x2019;s schedule. Cohen recalled that he spoke
with Lewandowski, who suggested that they speak again when Cohen had actual dates to
evaluate. Cohen indicated, however, that he knew that travel prior to the Republican National
Convention would be impossible given the candidate&#x2019;s preexisting commitments to the
Campaign.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Foresman—a New York-based investment banker—began reaching out to
Graff to secure an in-person meeting with candidate Trump. According to

Foresman first emailed Graff on March 31, 2016, following a phone introduction brokered
through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who produced the television show The

expertise in Russia and Ukraine, his work setting up an early ”private channel” between
Vladimir Putin and former U.S. President George W. Bush, and an ”approach” he had
received from ”senior Kremlin officials” about the candidate. Foresman asked Graff for a
meeting with the candidate, Corey Lewandowski, or ”another relevant person” to discuss
this and other ”concrete things” Foresman felt uncomfortable discussing over ”unsecure

When interviewed by the Office, Foresman denied that the specific ”approach” from ”senior
Kremlin officials” noted in his March 31, 2016 email was anything other than Kobyakov&#x2019;s
invitation to Roscongress. According to Foresman, the ”concrete things” he referenced in
the same email were a combination of the invitation itself, Foresman&#x2019;s personal
perspectives on the invitation and Russia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan
supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest Institute). Foresman told the Office that
Kobyakov had extended similar invitations through him to another Republican
presidential candidate and one other politician. Foresman also said that Kobyakov had
asked Foresman to invite Trump to speak after that other presidential candidate
withdrew from the race and the other politician&#x2019;s participation did not work

burnish his credentials to the Campaign. Foresman commented that he had not recognized
any of the experts announced as Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy team in March 2016, and wanted
to secure an in-person meeting with the candidate to share his professional background and
policy views, including that Trump should decline Kobyakov&#x2019;s invitation to speak at the

relevant period of time and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with
Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the
Russian government. That meeting never came to pass.

As early as the summer of 2015, he had sought a role as a policy advisor to the Campaign
but, in a September 30, 2015 email, he was told that the Campaign was not hiring policy
advisors.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-64002f396"></a> In
late 2015, Papadopoulos obtained a paid position on the campaign of Republican presidential candidate
Ben Carson.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn397x0" id="fn397x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">397</sup></a></span><a

</p><!--l. 477--><p class="indent" >   Although Carson remained in the presidential race until early March 2016,
Papadopoulos had stopped actively working for his campaign by early February
2016.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-64004f398"></a>
At that time, Papadopoulos reached out to a contact at the London Centre of
International Law Practice (LCILP), which billed itself as a ”unique institution
… comprising high-level professional international law practitioners, dedicated
to the advancement of global legal knowledge and the practice of international
law.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn399x0" id="fn399x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">399</sup></a></span><a

Papadopoulos said that he had finished his role with the Carson campaign and asked if LCILP was

</p><!--l. 487--><p class="indent" >   As he was taking his position at LCILP, Papadopoulos contacted
Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski via LinkedIn and emailed

 id="x1-64008f402"></a>
On March 2, 2016, Papadopoulos sent Glassner another message reiterating his
interest.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Glassner passed along word of Papadopoulos&#x2019;s interest to another campaign official, Joy
Lutes, who notified Papadopoulos by email that she had been told by Glassner to introduce
Papadopoulos to Sam Clovis, the Trump Campaign&#x2019;s national co-chair and chief policy
advisor.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 495--><p class="indent" >   At the time of Papadopoulos&#x2019;s March 2 email, the media was criticizing the Trump
Campaign for lack of experienced foreign policy or national security advisors within its
ranks.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn405x0" id="fn405x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">405</sup></a></span><a

 id="x1-64012f406"></a>
After receiving Papadopoulos&#x2019;s name from Lutes, Clovis performed a Google search on Papadopoulos,
learned that he had worked at the Hudson Institute, and believed that he had credibility on energy
issues.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn407x0" id="fn407x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">407</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-64013f407"></a>
On March 3, 2016, Clovis arranged to speak with Papadopoulos by phone to discuss
Papadopoulos joining the Campaign as a foreign policy advisor, and on March 6, 2016, the two
spoke.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn408x0" id="fn408x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">408</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-64014f408"></a>
Papadopoulos recalled that Russia was mentioned as a topic, and he understood from the
conversation that Russia would be an important aspect of the Campaign&#x2019;s foreign
policy.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn409x0" id="fn409x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">409</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-64015f409"></a>
At the end of the conversation, Clovis offered Papadopoulos a role as a
foreign policy advisor to the Campaign, and Papadopoulos accepted the
offer.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

   Approximately a week after signing on as a foreign policy advisor,
Papadopoulos traveled to Rome, Italy, as part of his duties with
LCILP.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Although Mifsud worked out of London and was also affiliated with

him.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

After Papadopoulos informed Mifsud about his role in the Trump

Papadopoulos told the Office that Mifsud&#x2019;s claim of substantial connections with
Russian government officials interested Papadopoulos, who thought that such
connections could increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Trump
Campaign.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Four days later, candidate Trump publicly named him as a member of the foreign

For example, within a week of her initial March 24 meeting with him, Polonskaya attempted
to send Papadopoulos a text message—which email exchanges show to have been drafted or

On April 18, 2016, while in Russia, Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos over email
to Ivan Timofeev, a member of the Russian International Affairs Council
(RIAC).<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Papadopoulos told the Office that, on one Skype call, he believed that his conversation
with Timofeev was being monitored or supervised by an unknown third party, because
Timofeev spoke in an official manner and Papadopoulos heard odd noises on the

Timofeev also told Papadopoulos in an April 25, 2016 email that he had just
spoken ”to Igor Ivanov[,] the President of RIAC and former Foreign Minister of
Russia,” and conveyed Ivanov&#x2019;s advice about how best to arrange a ”Moscow

During that meeting, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had met with high-level
Russian government officials during his recent trip to Moscow. Mifsud also said
that, on the trip, he learned that the Russians had obtained ”dirt” on candidate
Hillary Clinton. As Papadopoulos later stated to the FBI, Mifsud said that the
”dirt” was in the form of ”emails of Clinton,” and that they ”have thousands of
emails.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

On May 6, 2016, 10 days after that meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos suggested to a
representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received

Clinton.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

   While he was discussing with his foreign contacts a potential meeting of
campaign officials with Russian government officials, Papadopoulos kept campaign
officials apprised of his efforts. On April 25, 2016, the day before Mifsud told
Papadopoulos about the emails, Papadopoulos wrote to senior policy advisor
Stephen Miller that ”[t]he Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for
Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready,” and that ”[t]he advantage of being in
London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in &#x2019;neutral&#x2019;
cities.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

throughout the spring and summer of 2016. On May 4, 2016, he forwarded to

He included the same email in a May 21, 2016 message to senior Campaign official Paul Manafort,
under the subject line ”Request from Russia to meet Mr. Trump,” stating that ”Russia has
been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me to

Manafort forwarded the message to another Campaign official, without including
Papadopoulos, and stated: ”Let[&#x2019;]s discuss. We need someone to communicate that [Trump] is

<!--l. 1404--><p class="noindent" >On June 9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with
a Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from
the Russian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an
email from Robert Goldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov,
the son of Russian real-estate developer Aras Agalarov. Goldstone relayed to
Trump Jr. that the ”Crown prosecutor of Russia … offered to provide the Trump
Campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary
and her dealings with Russia” as ”part of Russia and its government&#x2019;s support
for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. immediately responded that ”if it&#x2019;s what you say
I love it,” and arranged the meeting through a series of emails and telephone
calls.
</p><!--l. 1409--><p class="indent" >   Trump Jr. invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared
Kushner to attend the meeting, and both attended. Members of the Campaign discussed
the meeting before it occurred, and Michael Cohen recalled that Trump Jr. may have told
candidate Trump about an upcoming meeting to receive adverse information about
Clinton, without linking the meeting to Russia. According to written answers submitted by
President Trump, he has no recollection of learning of the meeting at the time, and the
Office found no documentary evidence showing that he was made aware of the meeting—or
its Russian connection-before it occurred.
</p><!--l. 1413--><p class="indent" >   The Russian attorney who spoke at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had
previously worked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that
government throughout this period of time. She claimed that funds derived from
illegal activities in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats.
Trump Jr. requested evidence to support those claims, but Veselnitskaya did
not provide such information. She and her associates then turned to a critique
of the origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and
travel sanctions on Russian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on
adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr. suggested that the issue could be revisited
when and if candidate Trump was elected. After the election, Veselnitskaya made
additional efforts to follow up on the meeting, but the Trump Transition Team did not
engage.

<!--l. 1881--><p class="noindent" >Trump Campaign officials met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the week of
the Republican National Convention. The evidence indicates that those interactions were
brief and non-substantive. During platform committee meetings immediately
before the Convention, J.D. Gordon, a senior Campaign advisor on policy and
national security, diluted a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform
expressing support for providing ”lethal” assistance to Ukraine in response to
Russian aggression. Gordon requested that platform committee personnel revise the
proposed amendment to state that only ”appropriate” assistance be provided
to Ukraine. The original sponsor of the ”lethal” assistance amendment stated
that Gordon told her (the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate
Trump in connection with his request to dilute the language. Gordon denied
making that statement to the sponsor, although he acknowledged it was possible he
mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the subject matter.
The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the
candidate to make that proposal. Gordon said that he sought the change because
he believed the proposed language was inconsistent with Trump&#x2019;s position on
Ukraine.

   On August 3, 2016, an official from the Embassy of the Russian Federation in the United
States wrote to Gordon ”[o]n behalf of” Ambassador Kislyak inviting Gordon ”to have
breakfast/tea with the Ambassador at his residence” in Washington, D.C. the following

Gordon responded five days later to decline the invitation. He wrote, ”[t]hese days are not
optimal for us, as we are busily knocking down a constant stream of false media stories
while also preparing for the first debate with HRC. Hope to take a raincheck for
another time when things quiet down a bit. Please pass along my regards to the

Manafort had connections to Russia through his prior work for Russian oligarch Oleg
Deripaska and later through his work for a pro-Russian regime in Ukraine. Manafort stayed
in touch with these contacts during the campaign period through Konstantin Kilimnik, a
longtime Manafort employee who previously ran Manafort&#x2019;s office in Kiev and who the FBI
assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence.
</p><!--l. 2107--><p class="indent" >   Manafort instructed Rick Gates, his deputy on the Campaign and a longtime

to provide Kilimnik with updates on the Trump Campaign—including internal
polling data, although Manafort claims not to recall that specific instruction.
Manafort expected Kilimnik to share that information with others in Ukraine and
with Deripaska. Gates periodically sent such polling data to Kilimnik during the
campaign.
</p><!--l. 2114--><p class="indent" >   Manafort also twice met Kilimnik in the United States during the campaign
period and conveyed campaign information. The second meeting took place on
August 2, 2016, in New York City. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver
in person a message from former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who
was then living in Russia. The message was about a peace plan for Ukraine that
Manafort has since acknowledged was a ”backdoor” means for Russia to control
eastern Ukraine. Several months later, after the presidential election, Kilimnik
wrote an email to Manafort expressing the view—which Manafort later said he
shared—that the plan&#x2019;s success would require U.S. support to succeed: ”all that is
required to start the process is a very minor &#x2019;wink&#x2019; (or slight push) from [Donald
Trump].”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The email also stated that if Manafort were designated as the U.S. representative and
started the process, Yanukovych would ensure his reception in Russia ”at the very top
level.”
</p><!--l. 2122--><p class="indent" >   Manafort communicated with Kilimnik about peace plans for Ukraine on at least
four occasions after their first discussion of the topic on August 2: December
2016 (the Kilimnik email described above); January 2017; February 2017; and
again in the spring of 2018. The Office reviewed numerous Manafort email and

questions.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The investigation did not uncover evidence of Manafort&#x2019;s passing along information about
Ukrainian peace plans to the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or the Administration.
The Office was not, however, able to gain access to all of Manafort&#x2019;s electronic
communications (in some instances, messages were sent using encryption applications).
And while Manafort denied that he spoke to members of the Trump Campaign or the new
Administration about the peace plan, he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the
peace plan and his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was
among the reasons that the district judge found that he breached his cooperation
agreement.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would be ”good for
business” and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in the
Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with
him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a ”disagreement”—a
reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort&#x2019;s
credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data
after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others
he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a
connection between Manafort&#x2019;s sharing polling data and Russia&#x2019;s interference
in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the
time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort
otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference
efforts.

consulting work for Deripaska from approximately 2005 to 2009 and his separate
political consulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his
company DMP International LLC (DMI). Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev
during this entire period and continued to communicate with Manafort through

Stone had worked with Manafort from approximately 1980 until the mid-1990s

Manafort agreed to work on the Campaign without pay. Manafort had no meaningful income

   Manafort resigned from the Trump Campaign in mid-August 2016, approximately two weeks
after his second meeting with Kilimnik, amidst negative media reporting about his political
consulting work for the pro-Russian Party of Regions in Ukraine. Despite his resignation,
Manafort continued to offer advice to various Campaign officials through the November
election. Manafort told Gates that he still spoke with Kushner, Bannon, and candidate
Trump,<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn935x0" id="fn935x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">935</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-104001f935"></a>
and some of those post-resignation contacts are documented in emails. For
example, on October 21, 2016, Manafort sent Kushner an email and attached
a strategy memorandum proposing that the Campaign make the case against
Clinton ”as the failed and corrupt champion of the establishment” and that
”Wikileaks provides the Trump campaign the ability to make the case in a very
credible way—by using the words of Clinton, its campaign officials and DNC
members.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Later, in a November 5, 2016 email to Kushner entitled ”Securing the Victory,”
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Manafort stated that he was ”really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday
and focusing on preserving the victory,” and that he was concerned the Clinton
Campaign would respond to a loss by ”mov[ing] immediately to discredit the
[Trump] victory and claim voter fraud and cyber-fraud, including the claim that
the Russians have hacked into the voting machines and tampered with the
results.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 2516--><p class="indent" >   Manafort&#x2019;s activities in early 2017 included meetings relating to Ukraine and Russia.
The first meeting, which took place in Madrid, Spain in January 2017, was with Georgiy
Oganov. Oganov, who had previously worked at the Russian Embassy in the United States,
was a senior executive at a Deripaska company and was believed to report directly to
Deripaska.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Manafort initially denied attending the meeting. When he later acknowledged it, he
claimed that the meeting had been arranged by his lawyers and concerned only the Pericles
lawsuit.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Other evidence, however, provides reason to doubt Manafort&#x2019;s statement that the sole
topic of the meeting was the Pericles lawsuit. In particular, text messages to
Manafort from a number associated with Kilimnik suggest that Kilimnik and
Boyarkin—not Manafort&#x2019;s counsel—had arranged the meeting between Manafort and
Oganov.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Kilimnik&#x2019;s message states that the meeting was supposed to be ”not
about money or Pericles” but instead ”about recreating [the] old
friendship”—ostensibly between Manafort and Deripaska—”and talking about global
politics.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

through Russian Ambassador Kislyak and at other times through individuals who
sought reliable contacts through U.S. persons not formally tied to the Campaign or
Transition Team. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these
efforts. The investigation did not establish that these efforts reflected or constituted
coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia in its election-interference
activities.

Kushner in Kushner&#x2019;s capacity as CEO of Kushner Companies for the purpose of
discussing business, rather than as part of a diplomatic effort. In particular, VEB
characterized Gorkov&#x2019;s meeting with Kushner as part of a series of ”roadshow

included ”negotiations” and discussion of the ”most promising business lines and

<!--l. 3371--><p class="noindent" >Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was the Transition Team&#x2019;s
primary conduit for communications with the Russian Ambassador and dealt
with Russia on two sensitive matters during the transition period: a United

Despite Kushner&#x2019;s conclusion that Kislyak did not wield influence inside the Russian
government, the Transition Team turned to Flynn&#x2019;s relationship with Kislyak on both
issues. As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland, his incoming
deputy, to prepare for his call to Kislyak; McFarland was with the President-Elect
and other senior members of the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago at the time.
Although transition officials at Mar-a-Lago had some concern about possible
Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did not identify evidence that
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak. Flynn asked
Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to U.S. sanctions imposed on
December 29, 2016, and Kislyak later reported to Flynn that Russia acceded to that
request.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The Appointment Order authorized the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office “to prosecute federal
crimes arising from [its] investigation” of the matters assigned to it. In deciding whether to
exercise this prosecutorial authority, the Office has been guided by the Principles of Federal
Prosecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney&#x2019;s) Manual. In particular,
the Office has evaluated whether the conduct of the individuals considered for
prosecution constituted a federal offense and whether admissible evidence would
probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction for such an offense.
Justice Manual <span

the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial
federal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another
jurisdiction, and there existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution.

</p><!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   As explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets

similarly determined that the contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-linked
individuals either did not involve the commission of a federal crime or, in the case of
campaign-finance offenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a

Prosecution supported charging certain individuals connected to the Campaign with
making false statements or otherwise obstructing this investigation or parallel congressional
investigations.

Campaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaign official or any other U.S.
person with participating in the conspiracy. That is because the investigation did
not identify evidence that any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated
with the IRA knew that he or she was speaking with Russian nationals engaged
in the criminal conspiracy. The Office therefore determined that such persons
did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge them in the
conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count
alleging a wire- and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual
Russian nationals (Count Two). The Office did, however, charge one U.S. national
for his role in supplying false or stolen bank account numbers that allowed the
IRA conspirators to access U.S. online payment systems by circumventing those
systems&#x2019; security features. On February 12, 2018, Richard Pinedo pleaded guilty,

<!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >As explained in Section IV above, the Office&#x2019;s investigation uncovered evidence of
numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or
claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under
several sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents
who operate in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did
not pursue charges under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section
IV above—with the exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates
based on their activities on behalf of Ukraine. One of the interactions between the Trump
Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals—the June 9, 2016 meeting between
high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising derogatory information on
Hillary Clinton—implicates an additional body of law: campaign finance statutes.
Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources
raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As explained below, the
Office evaluated those questions in connection with the June 9 meeting <span class="redacted">________ ___</span>
<span class="redacted">________ ________</span>. The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal
questions were resolved favorably to the government, a prosecution would encounter
difficulties proving that Campaign officials or individuals connected to the Campaign
willfully violated the law. Finally, although the evidence of contacts between
Campaign officials and Russian-affiliated individuals may not have been sufficient
to establish or sustain criminal charges, several U.S. persons connected to the
Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to
obstruct the Office&#x2019;s investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing
justice.

 id="x1-1320001."></a>Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion</h5>
<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >As an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the
collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of “collusion,” but through the
lens of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word “collud[e]”
appears in the Acting Attorney General&#x2019;s August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has
frequently been invoked in public reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in
antitrust law, see, <span 
class="cmti-12">e.g., Brooke Group v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> Brown &#x0026; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</span>,
509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability
found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the
contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with
conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute,
18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 371. See <span 
class="cmti-12">Black&#x2019;s Law Dictionary </span>321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is “[a]n
agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain something forbidden by law”);
1 Alexander Burrill, <span 
class="cmti-12">A Law Dictionary and Glossary </span>311 (1871) (“An agreement
between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ
such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.”); 1 <span 
class="cmti-12">Bouvier&#x2019;s Law</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Dictionary </span>352 (1897) (“An agreement between two or more persons to defraud
a person of his rights by the forms of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by
law.”).
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   For that reason, this Office&#x2019;s focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability
was on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term “collusion.”
The Office considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials
and Russia-linked individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy—either
under statutes that have their own conspiracy language (e.g., 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span> 1349, 1951(a)),
or under the general conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 371). The investigation
did not establish that the contacts described in Volume I, Section IV, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>,
amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal
law—including foreign-influence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are discussed
further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with
the Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from
Russia contacts, either under a specific statute or under Section 371&#x2019;s offenses
clause.
</p><!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   The Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy
under Section 371&#x2019;s defraud clause. That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement
to obstruct a lawful function of the U.S. government or its agencies through deceitful or
dishonest means. See <span

<span 
class="cmti-12">Consulting LLC</span>, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38, 46 (D.D.C. 2018). The investigation did not
establish any agreement among Campaign officials—or between such officials and
Russia-linked individuals—to interfere with or obstruct a lawful function of a
government agency during the campaign or transition period. And, as discussed in
Volume I, Section V.A, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>, the investigation did not identify evidence that
any Campaign official or associate knowingly and intentionally participated in
the conspiracy to defraud that the Office charged, namely, the active-measures
conspiracy described in Volume I, Section II, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>. Accordingly, the Office did not
charge any Campaign associate or other U.S. person with conspiracy to defraud
the United States based on the Russia-related contacts described in Section IV

   The investigation uncovered extensive evidence that Paul Manafort&#x2019;s and
Richard Gates&#x2019;s pre-campaign work for the government of Ukraine violated FARA.
Manafort and Gates were charged for that conduct and admitted to it when they

The evidence underlying those charges is not addressed in this report because it was

</p><!--l. 239--><p class="indent" >   In brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald
Trump Jr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an “offer” from Russia&#x2019;s “Crown
prosecutor” to “the Trump campaign” of “official documents and information that would
incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.&#x2019;s]
father.” The email described this as “very high level and sensitive information” that is
“part of Russia and its government&#x2019;s support to Mr. Trump—helped along by Aras
and Emin.” Trump Jr. responded: “if it&#x2019;s what you say I love it especially later
in the summer.” Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov had follow-up conversations
and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was
attended by Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner. The communications setting up the
meeting and the attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an
inference that the Campaign anticipated receiving derogatory documents and
information from official Russian sources that could assist candidate Trump&#x2019;s electoral
prospects.
</p><!--l. 245--><p class="indent" >   This series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions
and donations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 30121(a)(1)(A). Specifically,
Goldstone passed along an offer purportedly from a Russian government official
to provide “official documents and information” to the Trump Campaign for
the purposes of influencing the presidential election. Trump Jr. appears to have
accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those materials.
Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that
Kushner and Manafort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting
anticipating the receipt of helpful information to the Campaign from Russian
sources.
</p><!--l. 250--><p class="indent" >   The Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracy to violate the
foreign contributions ban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 371; the solicitation of an
illegal foreign source contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of “an express or
implied promise to make a [foreign-source] contribution,” both in violation of
52 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2). There are reasonable arguments that the
offered information would constitute a “thing of value” within the meaning of these
provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely
to obtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons: first, the Office did
not obtain admissible evidence likely to meet the government&#x2019;s burden to prove
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
beyond a reasonable doubt that these individuals acted “willfully,” i.e., with general
knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and, second, the government would likely
encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the
promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation, see 52 U.S.C.

class="cmbx-12">Thing-of-Value Element</span></span> A threshold legal question is whether providing to a
campaign “documents and information” of the type involved here would constitute a
prohibited campaign contribution. The foreign contribution ban is not limited to
contributions of money. It expressly prohibits “a contribution or donation of money or

candidate-related opposition research given to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an
election could constitute a contribution to which the foreign-source ban could
apply. A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision of funds, but also by
the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns
frequently conduct and pay for opposition research. A foreign entity that engaged
in such research and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert
a greater effect on an election, and a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor
to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things of value. At the same
time, no judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of uncompensated
opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount to a
contribution under campaign-finance law. Such an interpretation could have implications
beyond the foreign-source ban, see 52 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 30116(a) (imposing monetary
limits on campaign contributions), and raise First Amendment questions. Those
questions could be especially difficult where the information consisted simply of the
recounting of historically accurate facts. It is uncertain how courts would resolve those
issues.

class="cmbx-12">Willfulness</span></span> Even assuming that the promised “documents and information that
would incriminate Hillary” constitute a “thing of value” under campaign-finance law, the
government would encounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction.
Most significantly, the government has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to
establish the scienter requirement beyond a reasonable doubt. To prove that a defendant
acted “knowingly and willfully,” the government would have to show that the defendant
had general knowledge that his conduct was unlawful. U.S. Department of Justice, <span 
class="cmti-12">Federal</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Prosecution of Election Offenses</span> 123 (8th ed. Dec. 2017) (“<span 
class="cmti-12">Election Offenses</span>”); <span 
class="cmti-12">see</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Bluman</span>, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation requires “proof of the
defendant&#x2019;s knowledge of the law”); <span 
class="cmti-12">Danielczyk</span>, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 577 (“knowledge of
general unlawfulness”). “This standard creates an elevated scienter element requiring, at
the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear.
When there is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts
of a particular matter, the offender is more likely to have an intent defense.”
<span 
class="cmti-12">Election Offenses</span> 123. On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had
general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful. The investigation has not
developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar with the
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual
context. The government does not have strong evidence of surreptitious behavior or
efforts at concealment at the time of the June 9 meeting. While the government
has evidence of later efforts to prevent disclosure of the nature of the June 9
meeting that could circumstantially provide support for a showing of scienter, <span 
class="cmti-12">see</span>
Volume II, Section II.G, <span 
class="cmti-12">infra</span>, that concealment occurred more than a year later,
involved individuals who did not attend the June 9 meeting, and may reflect an
intention to avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality.
Additionally, in light of the unresolved legal questions about whether giving “documents
and information” of the sort offered here constitutes a campaign contribution,
Trump Jr. could mount a factual defense that he did not believe his response to
the offer and the June 9 meeting itself violated the law. Given his less direct
involvement in arranging the June 9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar
defense. And, while Manafort is experienced with political campaigns, the Office has
not developed evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal
issues.

 id="x1-141000iii."></a><span 
class="cmbx-12">Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information</span></span> The Office would also encounter
difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised documents
and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal violation, as well
as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 30109(d)(1).
The type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary
contributions—such as pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the
upstream acquisition cost or the cost of distribution—would likely be unavailable or
ineffective in this factual setting. Although damaging opposition research is surely
valuable to a campaign, it appears that the information ultimately delivered in the
meeting was not valuable. And while value in a conspiracy may well be measured by
what the participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement, <span 
class="cmti-12">see, e.g.,</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> Tombrello</span>, 666 F.2d 485, 489 (11th Cir. 1982), Goldstone&#x2019;s
description of the offered material here was quite general. His suggestion of the
information&#x2019;s value—i.e., that it would “incriminate Hillary” and “would be very
useful to [Trump Jr.&#x2019;s] father”—was nonspecific and may have been understood as
being of uncertain worth or reliability, given Goldstone&#x2019;s lack of direct access
to the original source. The uncertainty over what would be delivered could be
reflected in Trump Jr.&#x2019;s response (“<span 
class="cmti-12">if it&#x2019;s what you say </span>I love it”) (emphasis
added).
   Accordingly, taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in
a campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required
valuation, the Office decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against
Trump Jr. or other campaign officials for the events culminating in the June 9

class="cmbx-12">George Papadopoulos</span></span> Investigators approached Papadopoulos for an interview
based on his role as a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign and his suggestion to
a foreign government representative that Russia had indicated that it could assist the
Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Clinton.
On January 27, 2017, Papadopoulos agreed to be interviewed by FBI agents, who informed
him that the interview was part of the investigation into potential Russian government
interference in the 2016 presidential election. During the interview, Papadopoulos
lied about the timing, extent, and nature of his communications with Joseph
Mifsud, Olga Polonskaya, and Ivan Timofeev. With respect to timing, Papadopoulos
acknowledged that he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians
had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” But Papadopoulos
stated multiple times that those communications occurred before he joined the
Trump Campaign and that it was a “very strange coincidence” to be told of
the “dirt” before he started working for the Campaign. This account was false.
Papadopoulos met Mifsud for the first time on approximately March 14, 2016,
after Papadopoulos had already learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for
the Campaign. Mifsud showed interest in Papadopoulos only after learning of
his role on the Campaign. And Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the Russians
possessing “dirt” on candidate Clinton in late April 2016, more than a month after
Papadopoulos had joined the Campaign and been publicly announced by candidate
Trump. Statement of Offense <span

Offense”).
   Papadopoulos also made false statements in an effort to minimize the extent and
importance of his communications with Mifsud. For example, Papadopoulos stated
that “[Mifsud]&#x2019;s a nothing,” that he thought Mifsud was “just a guy talk[ing]
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
up connections or something,” and that he believed Mifsud was “BS&#x2019;ing to be
completely honest with you.” In fact, however, Papadopoulos understood Mifsud to
have substantial connections to high-level Russian government officials and that
Mifsud spoke with some of those officials in Moscow before telling Papadopoulos
about the “dirt.” Papadopoulos also engaged in extensive communications over
a period of months with Mifsud about foreign policy issues for the Campaign,
including efforts to arrange a “history making” meeting between the Campaign
and Russian government officials. In addition, Papadopoulos failed to inform
investigators that Mifsud had introduced him to Timofeev, the Russian national who
Papadopoulos understood to be connected to the Russian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, despite being asked if he had met with Russian nationals or “[a]nyone
with a Russian accent” during the campaign. <span

</p><!--l. 390--><p class="indent" >   Papadopoulos also falsely claimed that he met Polonskaya before he joined the
Campaign, and falsely told the FBI that he had “no” relationship at all with her. He stated
that the extent of their communications was her sending emails—“Just, ‘Hi, how are you?&#x2019;
That&#x2019;s it.” In truth, however, Papadopoulos met Polonskaya on March 24, 2016, after he
had joined the Campaign; he believed that she had connections to high-level Russian
government officials and could help him arrange a potential foreign policy trip to Russia.
During the campaign he emailed and spoke with her over Skype on numerous occasions
about the potential foreign policy trip to Russia. <span

Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediately, those
statements hindered investigators&#x2019; ability to effectively question Mifsud when he was
interviewed in the lobby of a Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017. <span

Aug. 18, 2017), Doc. 44. During that interview, Mifsud admitted to knowing
Papadopoulos and to having introduced him to Polonskaya and Timofeev. But Mifsud
denied that he had advance knowledge that Russia was in possession of emails
damaging to candidate Clinton, stating that he and Papadopoulos had discussed
cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have
misunderstood their conversation. Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen
Papadopoulos since the meeting at which Mifsud introduced him to Polonskaya, even
though emails, text messages, and other information show that Mifsud met with
Papadopoulos on at least two other occasions—April 12 and April 26, 2016. In
addition, Mifsud omitted that he had drafted (or edited) the follow-up message
that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulos following the initial meeting and that,
as reflected in the language of that email chain (“Baby, thank you!”), Mifsud
may have been involved in a personal relationship with Polonskaya at the time.
The false information and omissions in Papadopoulos&#x2019;s January 2017 interview
undermined investigators&#x2019; ability to challenge Mifsud when he made these inaccurate

2017, four days after he had officially assumed his duties as National Security Advisor to
the President. During the interview, Flynn made several false statements pertaining to his
communications with the Russian ambassador. First, Flynn made two false statements
about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Kislyak in late December 2016, at a time
when the United States had imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering with the
2016 presidential election and Russia was considering its response. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Flynn</span>
Statement of Offense. Flynn told the agents that he did not ask Kislyak to refrain
from escalating the situation in response to the United States&#x2019;s imposition of
sanctions. That statement was false. On December 29, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to
request Russian restraint. Flynn made the call immediately after speaking to a
senior Transition Team official (K.T. McFarland) about what to communicate
to Kislyak. Flynn then spoke with McFarland again after the Kislyak call to
report on the substance of that conversation. Flynn also falsely told the FBI
that he did not remember a follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that
Russia had chosen to moderate its response to the U.S. sanctions as a result of
Flynn&#x2019;s request. On December 31, 2016, Flynn in fact had such a conversation with
Kislyak, and he again spoke with McFarland within hours of the call to relay
the substance of his conversation with Kislyak. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Flynn </span>Statement of Offense
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¶</span> 3.
   Second, Flynn made false statements about calls he had previously made to
representatives of Russia and other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to
the United Nations Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically, Flynn stated that
he only asked the countries&#x2019; positions on how they would vote on the resolution and that he
did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. That
statement was false. On December 22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak, informed him of the
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
incoming Trump Administration&#x2019;s opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia
vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn also falsely stated that Kislyak never described
Russia&#x2019;s response to his December 22 request regarding the resolution. Kislyak in
fact told Flynn in a conversation on December 23, 2016, that Russia would not
vote against the resolution if it came to a vote. <span

Cohen was involved in a project to build a Trump-branded tower and adjoining
development in Moscow. The project was known as Trump Tower Moscow. In 2017, Cohen
was called to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
(HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were
investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links
between Russia and the presidential campaigns. In late August 2017, in advance of his
testimony, Cohen caused a two-page statement to be sent to SSCI and HPSCI addressing
Trump Tower Moscow. <span

representations relevant here. First, Cohen stated that the Trump Moscow project had
ended in January 2016 and that he had briefed candidate Trump on the project
only three times before making the unilateral decision to terminate it. Second,
Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the
project and never considered asking Trump to travel for the project. Third, Cohen
stated that he did not recall any Russian government contact about the project,
including any response to an email that he had sent to a Russian government email

<span

   Each of the foregoing representations in Cohen&#x2019;s two-page statement was false and
misleading. Consideration of the project had extended through approximately June 2016
and included more than three progress reports from Cohen to Trump. Cohen had discussed
with Felix Sater his own travel to Russia as part of the project, and he had inquired about
the possibility of Trump traveling there—both with the candidate himself and with senior
campaign official Corey Lewandowski. Cohen did recall that he had received a
response to the email that he sent to Russian government spokesman Dmitry
Peskov—in particular, that he received an email reply and had a follow-up phone
conversation with an English-speaking assistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016. <span

admitted that he made them in an effort (1) to minimize the links between the
project and Trump (who by this time was President), and (2) to give the false
impression that the project had ended before the first vote in the Republican
Party primary process, in the hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations.
<span

</p><!--l. 471--><p class="indent" >   Given the nature of the false statements and the fact that he repeated them

class="cmbx-12">Jeff Sessions</span></span> As set forth in Volume I, Section IV.A.6, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>, the investigation
established that, while a U.S. Senator and a Trump Campaign advisor, former Attorney
General Jeff Sessions interacted with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the week of the
Republican National Convention in July 2016 and again at a meeting in Sessions&#x2019;s
Senate office in September 2016. The investigation also established that Sessions
and Kislyak both attended a reception held before candidate Trump&#x2019;s foreign
policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in April 2016, and
that it is possible that they met briefly at that reception. The Office considered
whether, in light of these interactions, Sessions committed perjury before, or made
false statements to, Congress in connection with his confirmation as Attorney
General. In January 2017 testimony during his confirmation hearing, Sessions
stated in response to a question about Trump Campaign communications with the
Russian government that he had “been called a surrogate at a time or two in that
campaign and I didn&#x2019;t have – did not have communications with the Russians.” In
written responses submitted on January 17, 2017, Sessions answered “[n]o” to
a question asking whether he had “been in contact with anyone connected to
any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or
after election day.” And, in a March 2017 supplement to his testimony, Sessions
identified two of the campaign-period contacts with Ambassador Kislyak noted above,
which had been reported in the media following the January 2017 confirmation
hearing. Sessions stated in the supplemental response that he did “not recall any
discussions with the Russian Ambassador, or any other representatives of the Russian
government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other
occasion.”
   Although the investigation established that Sessions interacted with Kislyak on the
occasions described above and that Kislyak mentioned the presidential campaign on at
least one occasion, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false
answers to Russia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions.
With respect to Sessions&#x2019;s statements that he did “not recall any discussions with the
Russian Ambassador … regarding the political campaign” and he had not been in contact
with any Russian official “about the 2016 election,” the evidence concerning the nature of
Sessions&#x2019;s interactions with Kislyak makes it plausible that Sessions did not recall
discussing the campaign with Kislyak at the time of his statements. Similarly,
while Sessions stated in his January 2017 oral testimony that he “did not have
communications with Russians,” he did so in response to a question that had linked such
communications to an alleged “continuing exchange of information” between the
Trump Campaign and Russian government intermediaries. Sessions later explained
to the Senate and to the Office that he understood the question as narrowly
calling for disclosure of interactions with Russians that involved the exchange of
campaign information, as distinguished from more routine contacts with Russian
nationals. Given the context in which the question was asked, that understanding is
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
plausible.
</p><!--l. 502--><p class="indent" >   Accordingly, the Office concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that
Sessions was willfully untruthful in his answers and thus insufficient to obtain or sustain a
conviction for perjury or false statements. Consistent with the Principles of Federal
Prosecution, the Office therefore determined not to pursue charges against Sessions and
informed his counsel of that decision in March 2018.

<span

<span 
class="cmr-10">shooting on June</span><span 
class="cmr-10"> 12, could well have caused the change. The President&#x2019;s written answers to our</span>
