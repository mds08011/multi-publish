<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 600.8(c), which
states that, ”[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel&#x2019;s work, he … shall provide the
Attorney General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions
[the Special Counsel] reached.”
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and
systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in
mid-2016. In June, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team
publicly announced that Russian hackers had compromised its computer network.
Releases of hacked materials—hacks that public reporting soon attributed to the
Russian government—began that same month. Additional releases followed in
July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in October and
November.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks&#x2019;s first release of stolen documents, a
foreign government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump
Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested
to a representative of that foreign government that the Trump Campaign had
received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign
through the anonymous release of information damaging to Democratic presidential
candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016,
to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference
activities.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government ”directed
recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political
organizations,” and, ”[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US
election process.” After the election, in late December 2016, the United States
imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election. By early 2017,
several congressional committees were examining Russia&#x2019;s interference in the
election.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   Within the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017
appointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the
Special Counsel authorized him to investigate ”the Russian government&#x2019;s efforts to
interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” including any links or coordination
between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation established that
Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First,
a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate
Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against
entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then
released stolen documents. The investigation also identified numerous links between
the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although the investigation
established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it
would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian
efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign
conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference
activities.

<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   Below we describe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements about the
results of our investigation and the Special Counsel&#x2019;s charging decisions, and we then
provide an overview of the two volumes of our report.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office found to be
supported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report
points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or
event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office
to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation
established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation
did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those
facts.
</p><!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals
constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of
”collusion.” In so doing, the Office recognized that the word ”collud[e]” was used in
communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the
investigation&#x2019;s scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting
about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in
the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons,
the Office&#x2019;s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as
defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question
whether members of the Trump Campaign ”coordinat[ed]”—a term that appears in the
appointment order—with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion,
”coordination” does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood
coordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump
Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the
other&#x2019;s actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when
stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump
Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference
activities.

 id="x1-50001"></a>Russian Social Media Campaign</h4>
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference
operations identified by the investigation—a social media campaign designed
to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States. The
IRA was based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and received funding from Russian
oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he controlled. Prigozhin is widely
reported to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________</span>

<span class="redacted">______</span>.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S.
political system through what it termed ”information warfare.” The campaign evolved from
a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system,
to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged
candidate Clinton. The IRA&#x2019;s operation also included the purchase of political
advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the
staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees
posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and
Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify
evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section
II of this report details the Office&#x2019;s investigation of the Russian social media
campaign.

</p>
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-60001"></a>Russian Hacking Operations</h4>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in
early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber
intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General
Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations.
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign
volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the
GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole
hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks.
Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government&#x2019;s role
in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the
fictitious online personas ”DCLeaks” and ”Guccifer 2.0.” The GRU later released
additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   The presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (”Trump Campaign” or ”Campaign”)
showed interest in WikiLeaks&#x2019;s releases of documents and welcomed their potential to
damage candidate Clinton. Beginning in June 2016, <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________ __________ _________</span>
<span class="redacted">______ ______ ___ ______</span> forecast to senior Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release
information damaging to candidate Clinton. WikiLeaks&#x2019;s first release came in July 2016.
Around the same time, candidate Trump announced that he hoped Russia would recover
emails described as missing from a private server used by Clinton when she was Secretary
of State (he later said that he was speaking sarcastically). <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________ __________ _________</span>
<span class="redacted">______ ______ ___ _______ ___________ ___________ _____ ___ ___ ________ _______</span> WikiLeaks began
releasing Podesta&#x2019;s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media
outlet released video considered damaging to candidate Trump. Section III of this
Report details the Office&#x2019;s investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as
well as other efforts by Trump Campaign supporters to obtain Clinton-related
emails.

   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-70001"></a>Russian Contacts with the Campaign</h4>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of
contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian
government. The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the
Campaign conspiring or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities.
Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would
benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the
Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released
through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump
Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election
interference activities.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the
Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy
positions seeking improved U.S.–Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the
contacts between Russia and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and
transition periods, the most salient of which are summarized below in chronological
order.
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">2015</span>. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump
Organization real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate
Trump signed a Letter of Intent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015,
and in January 2016 Trump Organization executive Michael Cohen emailed and
spoke about the project with the office of Russian government press secretary
Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through at least
June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate
Trump.
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Spring 2016</span>. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early
contact with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and
traveled to Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip,
Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Russian government had ”dirt” on Hillary Clinton in
the form of thousands of emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016,
Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump
Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could
assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging
to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months
thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a
meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took
place.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Summer 2016</span>. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer
of 2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for
President. On June 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump
Campaign officials Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul
Manafort to deliver what the email proposing the meeting had described as ”official
documents and information that would incriminate Hillary.” The materials were offered to
Trump Jr. as ”part of Russia and its government&#x2019;s support for Mr. Trump.”
The written communications setting up the meeting showed that the Campaign
anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist candidate Trump&#x2019;s
electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer&#x2019;s presentation did not provide such
information.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and
the DNC announced that Russian government hackers had infiltrated the DNC
and obtained access to opposition research on candidate Trump, among other
documents.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal
capacity to Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School. Page had
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
lived and worked in Russia between 2003 and 2007. After returning to the United States,
Page became acquainted with at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was
later charged in 2015 with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia. Page&#x2019;s July
2016 trip to Moscow and his advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention.
The Campaign then distanced itself from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him
from the Campaign.
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from
the DNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents
revealing information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public
reporting that U.S. intelligence agencies had ”high confidence” that the Russian
government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC. And
within a week of the release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its
May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian
government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign
government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination
between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign.
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   Separately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New
York City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses
to have ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a
peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office
was a ”backdoor” way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men
believed the plan would require candidate Trump&#x2019;s assent to succeed (were he to be
elected President). They also discussed the status of the Trump Campaign and
Manafort&#x2019;s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states. Months
before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with
Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August
meeting.
</p><!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Fall 2016</span>. On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking
in graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his
candidacy. Less than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of
John Podesta&#x2019;s emails that had been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016. The
FBI and other U.S. government institutions were at the time continuing their
investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere in the presidential
election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement ”that
the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US
persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.” Those ”thefts”
and the ”disclosures” of the hacked materials through online platforms such as
WikiLeaks, the statement continued, ”are intended to interfere with the US election
process.”
</p><!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-12">Post-2016 Election</span>. Immediately after the November 8 election, Russian government
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new
administration. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts.
The Russian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the
President-Elect and to arrange a call with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen
picked up the effort from there.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >   Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia&#x2019;s sovereign wealth fund, was among
the Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early
December, a business associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump
Campaign and an associate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince
later met face-to-face in January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.–Russia
relations. During the same period, another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a
friend of Jared Kushner who had not served on the Campaign or the Transition Team.
Dmitriev and Kushner&#x2019;s friend collaborated on a short written reconciliation
plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been cleared
through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration,
and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson.
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   On December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having
interfered in the election. Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian
Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response
to the sanctions. The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not
take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later,
President-Elect Trump tweeted, ”Great move on delay (by V. Putin).” The next day, on
December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him the request had been received at
the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result of Flynn&#x2019;s
request.

<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   On January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect
Trump on a joint assessment—drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence
Agency, FBI, and National Security Agency—that concluded with high confidence that
Russia had intervened in the election through a variety of means to assist Trump&#x2019;s
candidacy and harm Clinton&#x2019;s. A declassified version of the assessment was publicly
released that same day.
</p><!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees—the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)—announced that they
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
would conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian
interference in the election. Then-FBI Director James Comey later confirmed to Congress
the existence of the FBI&#x2019;s investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the
election. On March 20, 2017, in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey
stated:
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >

      and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals

advisors that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson
(Jeff) Sessions unrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel
removed, and engaged in efforts to curtail the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation and prevent
the disclosure of evidence to it, including through public and private contacts with
potential witnesses. Those and related actions are described and analyzed in Volume II of

 id="x1-80001"></a>The Special Counsel&#x2019;s Charging Decisions</h4>
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >In reaching the charging decisions described in Volume I of the report, the Office
determined whether the conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law
chargeable under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 9-27.000 et
seq. (2018). The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct
constitutes a crime; if so, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to
obtain and sustain a conviction; and whether prosecution would serve a substantial federal
interest that could not be adequately served by prosecution elsewhere or through
non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 9-27.220.
</p><!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office&#x2019;s charging decisions,
which contain three main components.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   First, the Office determined that Russia&#x2019;s two principal interference operations in the
2016 U.S. presidential election—the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping
operations—violated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the
social media campaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to
defraud the United States by undermining through deceptive acts the work of
federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influence in U.S. elections, as
well as related counts of identity theft. See <span 
class="cmti-12">United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> Internet Research</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Agency, et al.</span>, No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers
who carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal
email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to
violate, among other federal laws, the federal computer-intrusion statute, and
they have been so charged. <span 
class="cmti-12">See United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> Netyksho, et al.</span>, No. 18-cr-215
(D.D.C.).

<span class="redacted">______ __ _______ _______ _______</span>.
</p><!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties
to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the
evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the
evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered
agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence
about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks&#x2019;s releases of hacked materials
was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the
evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign
conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016
election.
</p><!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the
Trump Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the
investigation of Russian election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as
violations of the federal false-statements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael
Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak
during the transition period. George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the
campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about, inter alia, the nature and
timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the professor who told Papadopoulos that
the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.
Former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false
statements to Congress about the Trump Moscow project. <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________</span>
<span class="redacted">________ _______ ______ ______ ___ _______ ___________ ___________ _____ ___ ___ ________</span>
<span class="redacted">_______ __________ ___ ______ __ _______ _______ _______</span>. And in February 2019, the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that Manafort lied to the
Office and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with
Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for
Ukraine.
</p>
<div class="center" 
>
<!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 166--><hr width="10%"></div>
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve
potential Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that
interactions between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at
the candidate&#x2019;s April 2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week
of the Republican National Convention were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the
investigation did not establish that one Campaign official&#x2019;s efforts to dilute a
portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were
undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also did not
establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at
Sessions&#x2019;s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential
campaign.
</p><!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >   The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a
complete picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some
individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and
were not, in the Office&#x2019;s judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The
Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information—such as information known to
attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media—in light of internal
Department of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span> 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the
information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or ”taint”) team. Even when
individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that
was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above.
And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as
well—numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the
United States.
</p><!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >   Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose
conduct we investigated—including some associated with the Trump Campaign—deleted
relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications
that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or
communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness
statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully
question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known
facts.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office
believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified
gaps, the Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information
would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the
report.

class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 600.8(c), which
states that, “[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel&#x2019;s work, he … shall provide the
Attorney General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions
[the Special Counsel] reached.”
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Beginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards
the ongoing FBI investigation into Russia&#x2019;s interference in the 2016 presidential election
and related matters that raised questions about whether he had obstructed justice. The
Order appointing the Special Counsel gave this Office jurisdiction to investigate matters
that arose directly from the FBI&#x2019;s Russia investigation, including whether the President
had obstructed justice in connection with Russia-related investigations. The Special
Counsel&#x2019;s jurisdiction also covered potentially obstructive acts related to the
Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation itself. This Volume of our report summarizes our
obstruction-of-justice investigation of the President.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   We first describe the considerations that guided our obstruction-of-justice investigation,
and then provide an overview of this Volume:
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-12">First</span>, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to
initiate or decline a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional
prosecutorial judgment. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion
finding that “the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would
impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its
constitutionally assigned functions” in violation of “the constitutional separation of
powers.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x2" id="fn1x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-10001f1"></a>
Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the Department of Justice and the
framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 515; 28 C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 600.7(a),
this Office accepted OLC&#x2019;s legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial
jurisdiction. And apart from OLC&#x2019;s constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal
accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President&#x2019;s capacity to
govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential
misconduct.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x2" id="fn2x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-10002f2"></a>
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-12">Second</span>, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be
prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President&#x2019;s term is
permissible.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x2" id="fn3x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-10003f3"></a>
The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves
office.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn4x2" id="fn4x2-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-10004f4"></a>
And if individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be
prosecuted at this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong
public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a
thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh
and documentary materials were available.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-12">Third</span>, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under
the Justice Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions,
but we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a
judgment that the President committed crimes. The threshold step under the Justice
Manual standards is to assess whether a person&#x2019;s conduct “constitutes a federal
offense.” U.S. Dep&#x2019;t of Justice, Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 9-27.220 (2018) (Justice Manual).
Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when
no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond
to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural
protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly
accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor&#x2019;s
judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords
no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial
adjudicator.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-10005f5"></a>
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the
case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor&#x2019;s accusation of a crime, even in
an internal report, could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of
criminal justice. OLC noted similar concerns about sealed indictments. Even if an
indictment were sealed during the President&#x2019;s term, OLC reasoned, “it would be
very difficult to preserve [an indictment&#x2019;s] secrecy,” and if an indictment became
public, “[t]he stigma and opprobrium” could imperil the President&#x2019;s ability to
govern.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-10006f6"></a>
Although a prosecutor&#x2019;s internal report would not represent a formal public accusation akin
to an indictment, the possibility of the report&#x2019;s public disclosure and the absence of a
neutral adjudicatory forum to review its findings counseled against potentially
determining “that the person&#x2019;s conduct constitutes a federal offense.” Justice Manual

class="cmti-12">Fourth</span>, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the
President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the
facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.
The evidence we obtained about the President&#x2019;s actions and intent presents difficult issues
that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.
Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it
also does not exonerate him.

<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >During the 2016 presidential campaign, questions arose about the Russian government&#x2019;s
apparent support for candidate Trump. After WikiLeaks released politically damaging
Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump
publicly expressed skepticism that Russia was responsible for the hacks at the same time
that he and other Campaign officials privately sought information about any further
planned WikiLeaks releases. Trump also denied having any business in or connections to
Russia, even though as late as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a
licensing deal for a skyscraper to be built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow.
After the election, the President expressed concerns to advisors that reports of
Russia&#x2019;s election interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his
election.

<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >In mid-January 2017, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to
the Vice President, other administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to
Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about Russia&#x2019;s response to U.S. sanctions on Russia
for its election interference. On January 27, the day after the President was told that Flynn
had lied to the Vice President and had made similar statements to the FBI, the President
invited FBI Director Comey to a private dinner at the White House and told Comey that
he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President requested Flynn&#x2019;s
resignation, the President told an outside advisor, “Now that we fired Flynn, the
Russia thing is over.” The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would
continue.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
meeting with Comey. Referring to the FBI&#x2019;s investigation of Flynn, the President said, “I
hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I
hope you can let this go.” Shortly after requesting Flynn&#x2019;s resignation and speaking
privately to Comey, the President sought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T.
McFarland draft an internal letter stating that the President had not directed Flynn to
discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined because she did not know
whether that was true, and a White House Counsel&#x2019;s Office attorney thought that
the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been
offered.

 id="x1-150002"></a>The President&#x2019;s reaction to the continuing Russia investigation.</h5>
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >In February 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse
himself from campaign related investigations because of his role in the Trump Campaign.
In early March, the President told White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions
from recusing. And after Sessions announced his recusal on March 2, the President
expressed anger at the decision and told advisors that he should have an Attorney General
who would protect him. That weekend, the President took Sessions aside at an event and
urged him to “unrecuse.” Later in March, Comey publicly disclosed at a congressional
hearing that the FBI was investigating “the Russian government&#x2019;s efforts to interfere
in the 2016 presidential election,” including any links or coordination between
the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. In the following days, the
President reached out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask
them what they could do to publicly dispel the suggestion that the President
had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort. The President
also twice called Comey directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to
avoid direct contacts with the Department of Justice. Comey had previously
assured the President that the FBI was not investigating him personally, and the
President asked Comey to “lift the cloud” of the Russia investigation by saying that
publicly.

   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-160002"></a>The President&#x2019;s termination of Comey.</h5>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >On May 3, 2017, Comey testified in a congressional hearing, but declined to answer
questions about whether the President was personally under investigation. Within days, the
President decided to terminate Comey. The President insisted that the termination letter,
which was written for public release, state that Comey had informed the President that he
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White House maintained that
Comey&#x2019;s termination resulted from independent recommendations from the Attorney
General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling
the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the President had decided to fire
Comey before hearing from the Department of Justice. The day after firing Comey,
the President told Russian officials that he had “faced great pressure because of
Russia,” which had been “taken off by Comey&#x2019;s firing. The next day, the President
acknowledged in a television interview that he was going to fire Comey regardless of the
Department of Justice&#x2019;s recommendation and that when he “decided to just do it,” he
was thinking that “this thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.” In
response to a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia
investigation, the President said, “As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, I want that thing to be
absolutely done properly,” adding that firing Comey “might even lengthen out the
investigation.”

   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-170002"></a>The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him.</h5>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >On May 17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a
Special Counsel to conduct the investigation and related matters. The President reacted to
news that a Special Counsel had been appointed by telling advisors that it was “the end
of his presidency” and demanding that Sessions resign. Sessions submitted his
resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it. The President told aides
that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special
Counsel therefore could not serve. The President&#x2019;s advisors told him the asserted
conflicts were meritless and had already been considered by the Department of
Justice.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office was
investigating whether the President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this “a
major turning point” in the investigation: while Comey had told the President he was
not under investigation, following Comey&#x2019;s firing, the President now was under
investigation. The President reacted to this news with a series of tweets criticizing the
Department of Justice and the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation. On June 17, 2017, the
President called McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney
General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be
removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he
would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night
Massacre.

<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >Two days after directing McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President
made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19,
2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign
manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and
dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that
Sessions should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the
Russia investigation, the investigation was “very unfair” to the President, the
President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special
Counsel and “let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future
elections.” Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to
do.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the
President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel
investigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the
message would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly
criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of
tweets making it clear that Sessions&#x2019;s job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to
deliver the President&#x2019;s message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick
Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not
follow through.

 id="x1-190002"></a>Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence.</h5>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >In the summer of 2017, the President learned that media outlets were asking questions
about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials,
including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was said to be offering damaging
information about Hillary Clinton as “part of Russia and its government&#x2019;s support for
Mr. Trump.” On several occasions, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the
emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not leak and
that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited. Before the
emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by
deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with “an individual who
[Trump Jr.] was told might have information helpful to the campaign” and instead said
only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children. When the press
asked questions about the President&#x2019;s involvement in Trump Jr.&#x2019;s statement,
the President&#x2019;s personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any
role.

<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >In early summer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to
reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation. Sessions did not reverse his recusal. In
October 2017, the President met privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked him
to “take [a] look” at investigating Clinton. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded
guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, the President met with Sessions in the
Oval Office and suggested, according to notes taken by a senior advisor, that if
Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia investigation, he
would be a “hero.” The President told Sessions, “I&#x2019;m not going to do anything or
direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.” In response, Sessions
volunteered that he had never seen anything “improper” on the campaign and
told the President there was a “whole new leadership team” in place. He did not
unrecuse.

Counsel removed.</h5>
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >In early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to have the
Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather
than carry out the order. The President reacted to the news stories by directing White
House officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not
been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn told those officials
that the media reports were accurate in stating that the President had directed
McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed. The President then met with
McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the reports. In the same
meeting, the President also asked McGahn why he had told the Special Counsel
about the President&#x2019;s effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took
notes of his conversations with the President. McGahn refused to back away from
what he remembered happening and perceived the President to be testing his
mettle.

<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with the President and began
cooperating with the government, the President&#x2019;s personal counsel left a message for
Flynn&#x2019;s attorneys reminding them of the President&#x2019;s warm feelings towards Flynn, which he
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
said “still remains,” and asking for a “heads up” if Flynn knew “information that
implicates the President.” When Flynn&#x2019;s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer
share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President&#x2019;s personal counsel
said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn&#x2019;s actions reflected “hostility”
towards the President. During Manafort&#x2019;s prosecution and when the jury in his
criminal, trial was deliberating, the President praised Manafort in public, said that
Manafort was being treated unfairly, and declined to rule out a pardon. After
Manafort was convicted, the President called Manafort “a brave man” for refusing to
“break” and said that “flipping” “almost ought to be outlawed.” <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________</span>

 id="x1-230002"></a>Conduct involving Michael Cohen.</h5>
<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >The President&#x2019;s conduct towards Michael Cohen, a former Trump Organization executive,
changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized the President&#x2019;s involvement in
the Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when he became a cooperating
witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the Trump Tower Moscow
project on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed candidate Trump on the
project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to
advance the deal. In 2017, Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about
the project, including stating that he had only briefed Trump on the project
three times and never discussed travel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere
to a “party line” that Cohen said was developed to minimize the President&#x2019;s
connections to Russia. While preparing for his congressional testimony, Cohen had
extensive discussions with the President&#x2019;s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen,
said that Cohen should “stay on message” and not contradict the President.
After the FBI searched Cohen&#x2019;s home and office in April 2018, the President
publicly asserted that Cohen would not “flip,” contacted him directly to tell him
to “stay strong,” and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also
discussed pardons with the President&#x2019;s personal counsel and believed that if he
stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating
with the government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized
him, called him a “rat,” and suggested that his family members had committed
crimes.

evidence we obtained supports several general statements about the President&#x2019;s
conduct.
</p><!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >   Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical
obstruction-of-justice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President, and
some of his actions, such as firing the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts
within his Article II authority, which raises constitutional issues discussed below.
At the same time, the President&#x2019;s position as the head of the Executive Branch
provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing official proceedings,
subordinate officers, and potential witnesses—all of which is relevant to a potential
obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in
obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that
the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election
interference. Although the obstruction statutes do not require proof of such a crime,
the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of the President&#x2019;s intent and
requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct. Third, many of the
President&#x2019;s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the
government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That
circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the
reach of the obstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence
witnesses or alter their testimony, the harm to the justice system&#x2019;s integrity is the
same.
</p><!--l. 135--><p class="indent" >   Although the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern
of the President&#x2019;s conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the
President&#x2019;s acts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent. In particular, the
actions we investigated can be divided into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in
the President&#x2019;s motives. The first phase covered the period from the President&#x2019;s
first interactions with Comey through the President&#x2019;s firing of Comey. During
that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally under
investigation. Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special
Counsel, however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being
investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point, the President
engaged in a second phase of conduct, involving public attacks on the investigation,
non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage
witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation. Judgments about the nature of the
President&#x2019;s motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the
evidence.

<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice&#x2019;s general approach to
interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply
here. See 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span> 1503, 1505, 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) is
an omnibus obstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive
acts directed at pending or contemplated official proceedings. No principle of
statutory construction justifies narrowing the provision to cover only conduct that
impairs the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections 1503 and 1505 also offer
broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury, judicial,
administrative, and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a
provision in Section 1512(b) aimed specifically at conduct intended to prevent or
hinder the communication to law enforcement of information related to a federal
crime.

<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >As for constitutional defenses arising from the President&#x2019;s status as the head of
the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the
courts have not definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those
issues through the framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing
separation-of-powers issues. The Department of Justice and the President&#x2019;s personal
counsel have recognized that the President is subject to statutes that prohibit obstruction
of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury because that conduct does not
implicate his constitutional authority. With respect to whether the President can be
found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the
Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President&#x2019;s corrupt
use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of
justice.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >   Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and
permanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II
powers. The separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official
proceedings, including those of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts
regardless of their source. We also concluded that any inroad on presidential authority that
would occur from prohibiting corrupt acts does not undermine the President&#x2019;s
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
ability to fulfill his constitutional mission. The term “corruptly” sets a demanding
standard. It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to
obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official
duty and the rights of others. A preclusion of “corrupt” official action does not
diminish the President&#x2019;s ability to exercise Article II powers. For example, the proper
supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President to act with a
corrupt intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial
liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that
prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt purposes furthers, rather
than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. It also
aligns with the President&#x2019;s constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.
Finally, we concluded that in the rare case in which a criminal investigation of the
President&#x2019;s conduct is justified, inquiries to determine whether the President
acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance of his
constitutionally assigned duties. The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction
laws to the President&#x2019;s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our
constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the
law.

 id="x1-28000A."></a>Conclusion</h4>
<!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw
ultimate conclusions about the President&#x2019;s conduct. The evidence we obtained about the
President&#x2019;s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we
were making traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence
after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit
obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal
standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does
not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate
him.
