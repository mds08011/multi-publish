Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation itself. This Volume of our report summarizes our
obstruction-of-justice investigation of the President.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   We first describe the considerations that guided our obstruction-of-justice investigation,
and then provide an overview of this Volume:
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-12">First</span>, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to
initiate or decline a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional
prosecutorial judgment. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion
finding that “the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would
impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its
constitutionally assigned functions” in violation of “the constitutional separation of
powers.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f1"></a>
Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the Department of Justice and the
framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 515; 28 C.F.R. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 600.7(a),
this Office accepted OLC&#x2019;s legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial
jurisdiction. And apart from OLC&#x2019;s constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal
accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President&#x2019;s capacity to
govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential
misconduct.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2002f2"></a>
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-12">Second</span>, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be
prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President&#x2019;s term is
permissible.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x0" id="fn3x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2003f3"></a>
The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves
office.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn4x0" id="fn4x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2004f4"></a>
And if individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be
prosecuted at this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong
public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a
thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
and documentary materials were available.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-12">Third</span>, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under
the Justice Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions,
but we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a
judgment that the President committed crimes. The threshold step under the Justice
Manual standards is to assess whether a person&#x2019;s conduct “constitutes a federal
offense.” U.S. Dep&#x2019;t of Justice, Justice Manual <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 9-27.220 (2018) (Justice Manual).
Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when
no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond
to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural
protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly
accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor&#x2019;s
judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords
no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial
adjudicator.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn5x0" id="fn5x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2005f5"></a>
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the
case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor&#x2019;s accusation of a crime, even in
an internal report, could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of
criminal justice. OLC noted similar concerns about sealed indictments. Even if an
indictment were sealed during the President&#x2019;s term, OLC reasoned, “it would be
very difficult to preserve [an indictment&#x2019;s] secrecy,” and if an indictment became
public, “[t]he stigma and opprobrium” could imperil the President&#x2019;s ability to
govern.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn6x0" id="fn6x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2006f6"></a>
Although a prosecutor&#x2019;s internal report would not represent a formal public accusation akin
to an indictment, the possibility of the report&#x2019;s public disclosure and the absence of a
neutral adjudicatory forum to review its findings counseled against potentially
determining “that the person&#x2019;s conduct constitutes a federal offense.” Justice Manual
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 9-27.220.
</p><!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-12">Fourth</span>, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the
President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the
facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.
The evidence we obtained about the President&#x2019;s actions and intent presents difficult issues
that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.
Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it
also does not exonerate him.

 id="x1-5000"></a>The Campaign&#x2019;s response to reports about Russian support for Trump.</h5>
<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >During the 2016 presidential campaign, questions arose about the Russian government&#x2019;s
apparent support for candidate Trump. After WikiLeaks released politically damaging
Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump
publicly expressed skepticism that Russia was responsible for the hacks at the same time
that he and other Campaign officials privately sought information about any further
planned WikiLeaks releases. Trump also denied having any business in or connections to
Russia, even though as late as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a
licensing deal for a skyscraper to be built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow.
After the election, the President expressed concerns to advisors that reports of
Russia&#x2019;s election interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his
election.

   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn.</h5>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >In mid-January 2017, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to
the Vice President, other administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to
Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about Russia&#x2019;s response to U.S. sanctions on Russia
for its election interference. On January 27, the day after the President was told that Flynn
had lied to the Vice President and had made similar statements to the FBI, the President
invited FBI Director Comey to a private dinner at the White House and told Comey that
he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President requested Flynn&#x2019;s
resignation, the President told an outside advisor, “Now that we fired Flynn, the
Russia thing is over.” The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would
continue.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one
meeting with Comey. Referring to the FBI&#x2019;s investigation of Flynn, the President said, “I
hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I
hope you can let this go.” Shortly after requesting Flynn&#x2019;s resignation and speaking
privately to Comey, the President sought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T.
McFarland draft an internal letter stating that the President had not directed Flynn to
discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined because she did not know
whether that was true, and a White House Counsel&#x2019;s Office attorney thought that
the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been
offered.

   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>The President&#x2019;s reaction to the continuing Russia investigation.</h5>
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >In February 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse
himself from campaign related investigations because of his role in the Trump Campaign.
In early March, the President told White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions
from recusing. And after Sessions announced his recusal on March 2, the President
expressed anger at the decision and told advisors that he should have an Attorney General
who would protect him. That weekend, the President took Sessions aside at an event and
urged him to “unrecuse.” Later in March, Comey publicly disclosed at a congressional
hearing that the FBI was investigating “the Russian government&#x2019;s efforts to interfere
in the 2016 presidential election,” including any links or coordination between
the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. In the following days, the
President reached out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask
them what they could do to publicly dispel the suggestion that the President
had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort. The President
also twice called Comey directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to
avoid direct contacts with the Department of Justice. Comey had previously
assured the President that the FBI was not investigating him personally, and the
President asked Comey to “lift the cloud” of the Russia investigation by saying that
publicly.

</p>
   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>The President&#x2019;s termination of Comey.</h5>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >On May 3, 2017, Comey testified in a congressional hearing, but declined to answer
questions about whether the President was personally under investigation. Within days, the
President decided to terminate Comey. The President insisted that the termination letter,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
which was written for public release, state that Comey had informed the President that he
was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White House maintained that
Comey&#x2019;s termination resulted from independent recommendations from the Attorney
General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling
the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the President had decided to fire
Comey before hearing from the Department of Justice. The day after firing Comey,
the President told Russian officials that he had “faced great pressure because of
Russia,” which had been “taken off by Comey&#x2019;s firing. The next day, the President
acknowledged in a television interview that he was going to fire Comey regardless of the
Department of Justice&#x2019;s recommendation and that when he “decided to just do it,” he
was thinking that “this thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.” In
response to a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia
investigation, the President said, “As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, I want that thing to be
absolutely done properly,” adding that firing Comey “might even lengthen out the
investigation.”

   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him.</h5>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >On May 17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a
Special Counsel to conduct the investigation and related matters. The President reacted to
news that a Special Counsel had been appointed by telling advisors that it was “the end
of his presidency” and demanding that Sessions resign. Sessions submitted his
resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it. The President told aides
that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special
Counsel therefore could not serve. The President&#x2019;s advisors told him the asserted
conflicts were meritless and had already been considered by the Department of
Justice.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office was
investigating whether the President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this “a
major turning point” in the investigation: while Comey had told the President he was
not under investigation, following Comey&#x2019;s firing, the President now was under
investigation. The President reacted to this news with a series of tweets criticizing the
Department of Justice and the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation. On June 17, 2017, the
President called McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney
General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be
removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he
would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night
Massacre.

 id="x1-10000"></a>Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation.</h5>
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >Two days after directing McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President
made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19,
2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign
manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and
dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that
Sessions should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the
Russia investigation, the investigation was “very unfair” to the President, the
President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special
Counsel and “let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future
elections.” Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to
do.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the
President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel
investigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the
message would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly
criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of
tweets making it clear that Sessions&#x2019;s job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to
deliver the President&#x2019;s message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick
Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not
follow through.

   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a>Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence.</h5>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >In the summer of 2017, the President learned that media outlets were asking questions
about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials,
including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was said to be offering damaging
information about Hillary Clinton as “part of Russia and its government&#x2019;s support for
Mr. Trump.” On several occasions, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the
emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not leak and
that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited. Before the
emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by
deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with “an individual who
[Trump Jr.] was told might have information helpful to the campaign” and instead said
only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children. When the press
asked questions about the President&#x2019;s involvement in Trump Jr.&#x2019;s statement,
the President&#x2019;s personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any
role.

<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >In early summer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to
reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation. Sessions did not reverse his recusal. In
October 2017, the President met privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked him
to “take [a] look” at investigating Clinton. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded
guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, the President met with Sessions in the
Oval Office and suggested, according to notes taken by a senior advisor, that if
Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia investigation, he
would be a “hero.” The President told Sessions, “I&#x2019;m not going to do anything or
direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.” In response, Sessions
volunteered that he had never seen anything “improper” on the campaign and
told the President there was a “whole new leadership team” in place. He did not
unrecuse.

Counsel removed.</h5>
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >In early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to have the
Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather
than carry out the order. The President reacted to the news stories by directing White
House officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not
been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn told those officials
that the media reports were accurate in stating that the President had directed
McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed. The President then met with
McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the reports. In the same
meeting, the President also asked McGahn why he had told the Special Counsel
about the President&#x2019;s effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took
notes of his conversations with the President. McGahn refused to back away from
what he remembered happening and perceived the President to be testing his
mettle.

<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with the President and began
cooperating with the government, the President&#x2019;s personal counsel left a message for
Flynn&#x2019;s attorneys reminding them of the President&#x2019;s warm feelings towards Flynn, which he
said “still remains,” and asking for a “heads up” if Flynn knew “information that
implicates the President.” When Flynn&#x2019;s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer
share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President&#x2019;s personal counsel
said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn&#x2019;s actions reflected “hostility”
towards the President. During Manafort&#x2019;s prosecution and when the jury in his
criminal, trial was deliberating, the President praised Manafort in public, said that
Manafort was being treated unfairly, and declined to rule out a pardon. After
Manafort was convicted, the President called Manafort “a brave man” for refusing to
“break” and said that “flipping” “almost ought to be outlawed.” <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________</span>

<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >The President&#x2019;s conduct towards Michael Cohen, a former Trump Organization executive,
changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized the President&#x2019;s involvement in
the Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when he became a cooperating
witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the Trump Tower Moscow
project on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed candidate Trump on the
project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to
advance the deal. In 2017, Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about
the project, including stating that he had only briefed Trump on the project
three times and never discussed travel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere
to a “party line” that Cohen said was developed to minimize the President&#x2019;s
connections to Russia. While preparing for his congressional testimony, Cohen had
extensive discussions with the President&#x2019;s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen,
said that Cohen should “stay on message” and not contradict the President.
After the FBI searched Cohen&#x2019;s home and office in April 2018, the President
publicly asserted that Cohen would not “flip,” contacted him directly to tell him
to “stay strong,” and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also
discussed pardons with the President&#x2019;s personal counsel and believed that if he
stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating
with the government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized
him, called him a “rat,” and suggested that his family members had committed
crimes.

obstruction-of-justice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President, and
some of his actions, such as firing the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts
within his Article II authority, which raises constitutional issues discussed below.
At the same time, the President&#x2019;s position as the head of the Executive Branch
provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing official proceedings,
subordinate officers, and potential witnesses—all of which is relevant to a potential
obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in
obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that
the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election
interference. Although the obstruction statutes do not require proof of such a crime,
the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of the President&#x2019;s intent and
requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct. Third, many of the
President&#x2019;s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the
government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That
circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the
reach of the obstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence
witnesses or alter their testimony, the harm to the justice system&#x2019;s integrity is the
same.
</p><!--l. 135--><p class="indent" >   Although the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern
of the President&#x2019;s conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the
President&#x2019;s acts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent. In particular, the
actions we investigated can be divided into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in
the President&#x2019;s motives. The first phase covered the period from the President&#x2019;s
first interactions with Comey through the President&#x2019;s firing of Comey. During
that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally under
investigation. Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special
Counsel, however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being
investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point, the President
engaged in a second phase of conduct, involving public attacks on the investigation,
non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage
witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation. Judgments about the nature of the
President&#x2019;s motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the
evidence.

<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >The President&#x2019;s counsel raised statutory and constitutional defenses to a possible
obstruction-of-justice analysis of the conduct we investigated. We concluded that none of
those legal defenses provided a basis for declining to investigate the facts.

</p>
   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-18000A."></a>Statutory defenses.</h5>
<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice&#x2019;s general approach to
interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply
here. See 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§§</span> 1503, 1505, 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) is
an omnibus obstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive
acts directed at pending or contemplated official proceedings. No principle of
statutory construction justifies narrowing the provision to cover only conduct that
impairs the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections 1503 and 1505 also offer
broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury, judicial,
administrative, and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a
provision in Section 1512(b) aimed specifically at conduct intended to prevent or
hinder the communication to law enforcement of information related to a federal
crime.
</p><!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-19000A."></a>Constitutional defenses.</h5>
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >As for constitutional defenses arising from the President&#x2019;s status as the head of
the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the
courts have not definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those
issues through the framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing
separation-of-powers issues. The Department of Justice and the President&#x2019;s personal
counsel have recognized that the President is subject to statutes that prohibit obstruction
of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury because that conduct does not
implicate his constitutional authority. With respect to whether the President can be
found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the
Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President&#x2019;s corrupt
use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of
justice.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >   Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and
permanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II
powers. The separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
proceedings, including those of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts
regardless of their source. We also concluded that any inroad on presidential authority that
would occur from prohibiting corrupt acts does not undermine the President&#x2019;s
ability to fulfill his constitutional mission. The term “corruptly” sets a demanding
standard. It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to
obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official
duty and the rights of others. A preclusion of “corrupt” official action does not
diminish the President&#x2019;s ability to exercise Article II powers. For example, the proper
supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President to act with a
corrupt intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial
liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that
prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt purposes furthers, rather
than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. It also
aligns with the President&#x2019;s constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.
Finally, we concluded that in the rare case in which a criminal investigation of the
President&#x2019;s conduct is justified, inquiries to determine whether the President
acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance of his
constitutionally assigned duties. The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction
laws to the President&#x2019;s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our
constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the
law.

   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-20000A."></a>Conclusion</h4>
<!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw
ultimate conclusions about the President&#x2019;s conduct. The evidence we obtained about the
President&#x2019;s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we
were making traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence
after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit
obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal
standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does
not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate
him.

Office with jurisdiction to investigate “federal crimes committed in the course of, and with
intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction
of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.” 28 C.F.R.
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 600.4(a). Because of that description of our jurisdiction, we sought evidence for our
obstruction-of-justice investigation with the elements of obstruction offenses in mind. Our
evidentiary analysis is similarly focused on the elements of such offenses, although we do
not draw conclusions on the ultimate questions that govern a prosecutorial decision
under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual <span

</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   Here, we summarize the law interpreting the elements of potentially relevant
obstruction statutes in an ordinary case. This discussion does not address the unique
constitutional issues that arise in an inquiry into official acts by the President. Those
issues are discussed in a later section of this report addressing constitutional

</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Three basic elements are common to most of the relevant obstruction statutes: (1) an
obstructive act; (2) a nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and

<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   Taking into account that information and our analysis of applicable statutory and
constitutional principles (discussed below in Volume II, Section III, <span

that there was a sufficient factual and legal basis to further investigate potential
obstruction-of-justice issues involving the President.
</p><!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >   Many of the core issues in an obstruction-of-justice investigation turn on an individual&#x2019;s
actions and intent. We therefore requested that the White House provide us with
documentary evidence in its possession on the relevant events. We also sought and obtained
the White House&#x2019;s concurrence in our conducting interviews of White House personnel who
had relevant information. And we interviewed other witnesses who had pertinent
knowledge, obtained documents on a voluntary basis when possible, and used legal process
where appropriate. These investigative steps allowed us to gather a substantial amount of
evidence.
</p><!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   We also sought a voluntary interview with the President. After more than a year
of discussion, the President declined to be interviewed. <span class="redacted">_________ _______</span> During the
course of our discussions, the President did agree to answer written questions on
certain Russia-related topics, and he provided us with answers. He did not similarly
agree to provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions
on events during the transition. Ultimately, while we believed that we had the
authority and legal justification to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the
President&#x2019;s testimony, we chose not to do so. We made that decision in view of the
substantial delay that such an investigative step would likely produce at a late
stage in our investigation. We also assessed that based on the significant body
of evidence we had already obtained of the President&#x2019;s actions and his public
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
and private statements describing or explaining those actions, we had sufficient
evidence to understand relevant events and to make certain assessments without the
President&#x2019;s testimony. The Office&#x2019;s decision-making process on this issue is described in
more detail in Appendix C, <span 
class="cmti-12">infra</span>, in a note that precedes the President&#x2019;s written
responses.
</p><!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >   In assessing the evidence we obtained, we relied on common principles that apply in any
investigation. The issue of criminal intent is often inferred from circumstantial evidence.
<span 
class="cmti-12">See, e.g., United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> Croteau</span>, 819 F.3d 1293, 1305 (11th Cir. 2016) (“[G]uilty

as knowledge or intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence.”) (internal quotation

government&#x2019;s case rested on circumstantial evidence, but the mens rea elements of
knowledge and intent can often be proved through circumstantial evidence and the
reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). The principle
that intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence is a necessity in criminal cases,
given the right of a subject to assert his privilege against compelled self-incrimination
under the Fifth Amendment and therefore decline to testify. Accordingly, determinations
on intent are frequently reached without the opportunity to interview an investigatory
subject.
</p><!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >   Obstruction-of-justice cases are consistent with this rule. <span 
class="cmti-12">See, e.g., Edlind</span>, 887 F.3d

</p><!--l. 178--><p class="indent" >   Credibility judgments may also be made based on objective facts and circumstantial
evidence. Standard jury instructions highlight a variety of factors that are often
relevant in assessing credibility. These include whether a witness had a reason not to

had the opportunity to observe the events about which he testified; whether the
witness&#x2019;s testimony was corroborated by other witnesses; and whether anything the
witness said or wrote previously contradicts his testimony. <span

</p><!--l. 188--><p class="indent" >   In addition to those general factors, we took into account more specific factors in
assessing the credibility of conflicting accounts of the facts. For example, contemporaneous
written notes can provide strong corroborating evidence. <span 
class="cmti-12">See United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> Nobles</span>,
422 U.S. 225, 232 (1975) (the fact that a “statement appeared in the contemporaneously
recorded report … would tend strongly to corroborate the investigator&#x2019;s version of the
interview”). Similarly, a witness&#x2019;s recitation of his account before he had any motive to
fabricate also supports the witness&#x2019;s credibility. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Tome v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> United States</span>, 513 U.S. 150,
158 (1995) (“A consistent statement that predates the motive is a square rebuttal of the
charge that the testimony was contrived as a consequence of that motive.”). Finally, a
witness&#x2019;s false description of an encounter can imply consciousness of wrongdoing. <span

<span 
class="cmti-12">Al-Adahi v.</span><span

We applied those settled legal principles in evaluating the factual results of our
investigation.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >This section of the report details the evidence we obtained. We first provide an
overview of how Russia became an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, and how
candidate Trump responded. We then turn to the key events that we investigated:
the President&#x2019;s conduct concerning the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn; the
President&#x2019;s reaction to public confirmation of the FBI&#x2019;s Russia investigation; events
leading up to and surrounding the termination of FBI Director Comey; efforts to

investigation; efforts to prevent disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 Trump

Attorney General unrecuse; and conduct towards McGahn, Cohen, and other
witnesses.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   We summarize the evidence we found and then analyze it by reference to the three
statutory obstruction-of-justice elements: obstructive act, nexus to a proceeding, and
intent. We focus on elements because, by regulation, the Special Counsel has “jurisdiction
… to investigate … federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere
with, the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice,
destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.” 28 C.F.R. <span

Consistent with our jurisdiction to investigate federal obstruction crimes, we
gathered evidence that is relevant to the elements of those crimes and analyzed
them within an elements framework—while refraining from reaching ultimate
conclusions about whether crimes were committed, for the reasons explained above.

The questions intensified after WikiLeaks released politically damaging Democratic Party
emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia. Trump responded to questions
about possible connections to Russia by denying any business involvement in Russia—even
though the Trump Organization had pursued a business project in Russia as late as June
2016. Trump also expressed skepticism that Russia had hacked the emails at the same time
as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information about any further planned
WikiLeaks releases. After the election, when questions persisted about possible

response to U.S. sanctions imposed because of Russia&#x2019;s election interference. After the press
reported on Flynn&#x2019;s contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Flynn lied to incoming
Administration officials by saying he had not discussed sanctions on the calls. The officials
publicly repeated those lies in press interviews. The FBI, which previously was
investigating Flynn for other matters, interviewed him about the calls in the first week
after the inauguration, and Flynn told similar lies to the FBI. On January 26, 2017,
Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House that Flynn and the Russian
Ambassador had discussed sanctions and that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI. The
next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James Comey in which he
asked for Comey&#x2019;s loyalty. On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn to resign. The
following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Comey in which
he said, ”I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn
go.”

Based on his preliminary research, Eisenberg informed McGahn that there

Eisenberg noted that the United States had never successfully prosecuted an individual
under the Logan Act and that Flynn could have possible defenses, and told McGahn that

circumstances.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 976--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#x2019;s conduct related to the Flynn investigation, the following
evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 978--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> According to Comey&#x2019;s account of his February 14, 2017 meeting in the
Oval Office, the President told him, ”I hope you can see your way clear to letting
this go, to letting Flynn go. … I hope you can let this go.” In analyzing whether
these statements constitute an obstructive act, a threshold question is whether
Comey&#x2019;s account of the interaction is accurate, and, if so, whether the President&#x2019;s
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
statements had the tendency to impede the administration of justice by shutting
down an inquiry that could result in a grand jury investigation and a criminal
charge.
</p><!--l. 983--><p class="indent" >   After Comey&#x2019;s account of the President&#x2019;s request to ”let[] Flynn go” became public, the
President publicly disputed several aspects of the story. The President told the New York
Times that he did not ”shoo other people out of the room” when he talked to
Comey and that he did not remember having a one-on-one conversation with
Comey.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn268x0" id="fn268x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">268</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-44017f268"></a>
The President also publicly denied that he had asked Comey to ”let[] Flynn
go” or otherwise communicated that Comey should drop the investigation of
Flynn.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn269x0" id="fn269x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">269</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-44018f269"></a> In
private, the President denied aspects of Comey&#x2019;s account to White House advisors, but acknowledged
to Priebus that he brought Flynn up in the meeting with Comey and stated that Flynn was a good
guy.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn270x0" id="fn270x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">270</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-44019f270"></a>
Despite those denials, substantial evidence corroborates Comey&#x2019;s account.
</p><!--l. 1003--><p class="indent" >   First, Comey wrote a detailed memorandum of his encounter with the President on the same
day it occurred. Comey also told senior FBI officials about the meeting with the President that
day, and their recollections of what Comey told them at the time are consistent with Comey&#x2019;s
account.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn271x0" id="fn271x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">271</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-44020f271"></a>
</p><!--l. 1008--><p class="indent" >   Second, Comey provided testimony about the President&#x2019;s request that he ”let[] Flynn
go” under oath in congressional proceedings and in interviews with federal investigators
subject to penalties for lying under 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 1001. Comey&#x2019;s recollections of the
encounter have remained consistent over time.
</p><!--l. 1011--><p class="indent" >   Third, the objective, corroborated circumstances of how the one-on-one meeting
came to occur support Comey&#x2019;s description of the event. Comey recalled that the
President cleared the room to speak with Comey alone after a homeland security
briefing in the Oval Office, that Kushner and Sessions lingered and had to be
shooed out by the President, and that Priebus briefly opened the door during the
meeting, prompting the President to wave him away. While the President has
publicly denied those details, other Administration officials who were present have
confirmed Comey&#x2019;s account of how he ended up in a one-on-one meeting with the
President.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn272x0" id="fn272x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">272</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-44021f272"></a>
And the President acknowledged to Priebus and McGahn that he in fact spoke to Comey
about Flynn in their one-on-one meeting.
</p><!--l. 1018--><p class="indent" >   Fourth, the President&#x2019;s decision to clear the room and, in particular, to exclude the
Attorney General from the meeting signals that the President wanted to be alone with
Comey, which is consistent with the delivery of a message of the type that Comey recalls,
rather than a more innocuous conversation that could have occurred in the presence of the
Attorney General.
</p><!--l. 1020--><p class="indent" >   Finally, Comey&#x2019;s reaction to the President&#x2019;s statements is consistent with the President
having asked him to ”let[] Flynn go.” Comey met with the FBI leadership team, which
agreed to keep the President&#x2019;s statements closely held and not to inform the team working
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
on the Flynn investigation so that they would not be influenced by the President&#x2019;s request.
Comey also promptly met with the Attorney General to ask him not to be left
alone with the President again, an account verified by Sessions, FBI Chief of Staff
James Rybicki, and Jody Hunt, who was then the Attorney General&#x2019;s chief of
staff.
</p><!--l. 1024--><p class="indent" >   A second question is whether the President&#x2019;s statements, which were not phrased as a
direct order to Comey, could impede or interfere with the FBI&#x2019;s investigation of Flynn.
While the President said he ”hope[d]” Comey could ”let[] Flynn go,” rather than
affirmatively directing him to do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the
President was asking Comey to close the FBI&#x2019;s investigation into Flynn. First, the
President arranged the meeting with Comey so that they would be alone and purposely
excluded the Attorney General, which suggests that the President meant to make a
request to Comey that he did not want anyone else to hear. Second, because the
President is the head of the Executive Branch, when he says that he ”hopes” a
subordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will
do what the President wants. Indeed, the President repeated a version of ”let
this go” three times, and Comey testified that he understood the President&#x2019;s
statements as a directive, which is corroborated by the way Comey reacted at the
time.
</p><!--l. 1030--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to a proceeding.</span> To establish a nexus to a proceeding, it would be necessary
to show that the President could reasonably foresee and actually contemplated
that the investigation of Flynn was likely to lead to a grand jury investigation or
prosecution.
</p><!--l. 1033--><p class="indent" >   At the time of the President&#x2019;s one-on-one meeting with Comey, no grand jury
subpoenas had been issued as part of the FBI&#x2019;s investigation into Flynn. But
Flynn&#x2019;s lies to the FBI violated federal criminal law, <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________ _________</span>, and
resulted in Flynn&#x2019;s prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 1001. By the time the
President spoke to Comey about Flynn, DOJ officials had informed McGahn, who
informed the President, that Flynn&#x2019;s statements to senior White House officials
about his contacts with Kislyak were not true and that Flynn had told the same
version of events to the FBI. McGahn also informed the President that Flynn&#x2019;s
conduct could violate 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 1001. After the Vice President and senior
White House officials reviewed the underlying information about Flynn&#x2019;s calls
on February 10, 2017, they believed that Flynn could not have forgotten his
conversations with Kislyak and concluded that he had been lying. In addition,
the President&#x2019;s instruction to the FBI Director to ”let[] Flynn go” suggests his
awareness that Flynn could face criminal exposure for his conduct and was at risk of
prosecution.
</p><!--l. 1040--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> As part of our investigation, we examined whether the President had a personal
stake in the outcome of an investigation into Flynn—for example, whether the President
was aware of Flynn&#x2019;s communications with Kislyak close in time to when they occurred,
such that the President knew that Flynn had lied to senior White House officials and that
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
those lies had been passed on to the public. Some evidence suggests that the
President knew about the existence and content of Flynn&#x2019;s calls when they occurred,
but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be relied upon to establish the
President&#x2019;s knowledge. In advance of Flynn&#x2019;s initial call with Kislyak, the President
attended a meeting where the sanctions were discussed and an advisor may have
mentioned that Flynn was scheduled to talk to Kislyak. Flynn told McFarland
about the substance of his calls with Kislyak and said they may have made a
difference in Russia&#x2019;s response, and Flynn recalled talking to Bannon in early January
2017 about how they had successfully ”stopped the train on Russia&#x2019;s response”
to the sanctions. It would have been reasonable for Flynn to have wanted the
President to know of his communications with Kislyak because Kislyak told Flynn
his request had been received at the highest levels in Russia and that Russia
had chosen not to retaliate in response to the request, and the President was
pleased by the Russian response, calling it a ”[g]reat move.” And the President
never said publicly or internally that Flynn had lied to him about the calls with
Kislyak.
</p><!--l. 1048--><p class="indent" >   But McFarland did not recall providing the President-Elect with Flynn&#x2019;s read-out of his
calls with Kislyak, and Flynn does not have a specific recollection of telling the
President-Elect directly about the calls. Bannon also said he did not recall hearing about
the calls from Flynn. And in February 2017, the President asked Flynn what was discussed
on the calls and whether he had lied to the Vice President, suggesting that he did not
already know. Our investigation accordingly did not produce evidence that established that
the President knew about Flynn&#x2019;s discussions of sanctions before the Department of Justice
notified the White House of those discussions in late January 2017. The evidence also does
not establish that Flynn otherwise possessed information damaging to the President that
would give the President a personal incentive to end the FBI&#x2019;s inquiry into Flynn&#x2019;s
conduct.
</p><!--l. 1054--><p class="indent" >   Evidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the
FBI&#x2019;s broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told Christie, that
terminating Flynn would end ”the whole Russia thing.” Flynn&#x2019;s firing occurred
at a time when the media and Congress were raising questions about Russia&#x2019;s
interference in the election and whether members of the President&#x2019;s campaign
had colluded with Russia. Multiple witnesses recalled that the President viewed
the Russia investigations as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election. The
President paid careful attention to negative coverage of Flynn and reacted with
annoyance and anger when the story broke disclosing that Flynn had discussed
sanctions with Kislyak. Just hours before meeting one-on-one with Comey, the
President told Christie that firing Flynn would put an end to the Russia inquiries.
And after Christie pushed back, telling the President that firing Flynn would
not end the Russia investigation, the President asked Christie to reach out to
Comey and convey that the President liked him and he was part of ”the team.”
That afternoon, the President cleared the room and asked Comey to ”let[] Flynn
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
go.”
</p><!--l. 1062--><p class="indent" >   We also sought evidence relevant to assessing whether the President&#x2019;s direction to
Comey was motivated by sympathy towards Flynn. In public statements the
President repeatedly described Flynn as a good person who had been harmed by the
Russia investigation, and the President directed advisors to reach out to Flynn to
tell him the President ”care[d]” about him and felt bad for him. At the same
time, multiple senior advisors, including Bannon, Priebus, and Hicks, said that
the President had become unhappy with Flynn well before Flynn was forced to
resign and that the President was frequently irritated with Flynn. Priebus said he
believed the President&#x2019;s initial reluctance to fire Flynn stemmed not from personal
regard, but from concern about the negative press that would be generated by
firing the National Security Advisor so early in the Administration. And Priebus
indicated that the President&#x2019;s post-firing expressions of support for Flynn were
motivated by the President&#x2019;s desire to keep Flynn from saying negative things about
him.
</p><!--l. 1068--><p class="indent" >   The way in which the President communicated the request to Comey also is relevant to
understanding the President&#x2019;s intent. When the President first learned about the FBI
investigation into Flynn, he told McGahn, Bannon, and Priebus not to discuss the matter
with anyone else in the White House. The next day, the President invited Comey for a
one-on-one dinner against the advice of an aide who recommended that other White House
officials also attend. At the dinner, the President asked Comey for ”loyalty” and, at a
different point in the conversation, mentioned that Flynn had judgment issues. When the
President met with Comey the day after Flynn&#x2019;s termination—shortly after being told by
Christie that firing Flynn would not end the Russia investigation—the President
cleared the room, even excluding the Attorney General, so that he could again
speak to Comey alone. The President&#x2019;s decision to meet one-on-one with Comey
contravened the advice of the White House Counsel that the President should not
communicate directly with the Department of Justice to avoid any appearance of
interfering in law enforcement activities. And the President later denied that he
cleared the room and asked Comey to ”let[] Flynn go”—a denial that would have
been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise of prosecutorial
discretion.
</p><!--l. 1076--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the President&#x2019;s effort to have McFarland write an internal email denying that
the President had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak highlights the
President&#x2019;s concern about being associated with Flynn&#x2019;s conduct. The evidence does not
establish that the President was trying to have McFarland lie. The President&#x2019;s
request, however, was sufficiently irregular that McFarland—who did not know
the full extent of Flynn&#x2019;s communications with the President and thus could
not make the representation the President wanted—felt the need to draft an
internal memorandum documenting the President&#x2019;s request, and Eisenberg was
concerned that the request would look like a quid pro quo in exchange for an
ambassadorship.

asked Sessions to ”unrecuse.” On March 20, 2017, Comey publicly disclosed the
existence of the FBI&#x2019;s Russia investigation. In the days that followed, the President
contacted Comey and other intelligence agency leaders and asked them to push
back publicly on the suggestion that the President had any connection to the
Russian election-interference effort in order to ”lift the cloud” of the ongoing
investigation.

<!--l. 1097--><p class="noindent" >In late February 2017, the Department of Justice began an internal analysis of whether
Sessions should recuse from the Russia investigation based on his role in the 2016 Trump

On March 1, 2017, the press reported that, in his January confirmation hearing to become
Attorney General, Senator Sessions had not disclosed two meetings he had with Russian
Ambassador Kislyak before the presidential election, leading to congressional calls for Sessions
to recuse or for a special counsel to investigate Russia&#x2019;s interference in the presidential
election.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 1103--><p class="indent" >   Also on March 1, the President called Comey and said he wanted to check in and see how Comey
was doing.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn275x0" id="fn275x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">275</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-46003f275"></a>
According to an email Comey sent to his chief of staff after the call, the President ”talked
about Sessions a bit,” said that he had heard Comey was ”doing great,” and said
that he hoped Comey would come by to say hello when he was at the White
House.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Comey interpreted the call as an effort by the President to ”pull [him] in,” but he did not perceive
the call as an attempt by the President to find out what Comey was doing with the Flynn
investigation.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-46006f278"></a>
McGahn understood the President to be concerned that a recusal would make
Sessions look guilty for omitting details in his confirmation hearing; leave the
President unprotected from an investigation that could hobble the presidency
and derail his policy objectives; and detract from favorable press coverage of
a Presidential Address to Congress the President had delivered earlier in the
week.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-46010f282"></a>
Throughout the day, McGahn continued trying on behalf of the President to avert
Sessions&#x2019;s recusal by speaking to Sessions&#x2019;s personal counsel, Sessions&#x2019;s chief of staff, and
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and by contacting Sessions himself two more

According to Comey&#x2019;s contemporaneous record of the conversation, the President said ”he

difficult.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn361x0" id="fn361x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">361</sup></a></span><a

Comey explained ”that we were running it down as quickly as possible and that there would be great

work.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The President commented that if there was ”some satellite” (which Comey took to
mean an associate of the President&#x2019;s or the campaign) that did something, ”it
would be good to find that out” but that he himself had not done anything wrong

 id="x1-49009f368"></a>
According to Comey&#x2019;s contemporaneous record of the conversation, the

Comey responded that he had passed the request to Boente but not heard

such a request would be to have the White House Counsel contact DOJ
leadership.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

In a televised interview that was taped early that afternoon, the President was asked if it was
too late for him to ask Comey to step down; the President responded, ”No, it&#x2019;s not too late,

 id="x1-49016f375"></a>
The President acknowledged that McGahn would not approve of the outreach to Comey
because McGahn had previously cautioned the President that he should not talk to Comey
directly to prevent any perception that the White House was interfering with
investigations.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn376x0" id="fn376x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">376</sup></a></span><a

cleared it.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn378x0" id="fn378x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">378</sup></a></span><a

 id="x1-49020f379"></a>
According to McGahn, Boente responded that he did not want to issue a statement about the
President not being under investigation because of the potential political ramifications and did
not want to order Comey to do it because that action could prompt the appointment of a Special
Counsel.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 1468--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#x2019;s reaction to Sessions&#x2019;s recusal and the requests he made to
Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of
obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 1470--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> The evidence shows that, after Comey&#x2019;s March 20, 2017 testimony,
the President repeatedly reached out to intelligence agency leaders to discuss
the FBI&#x2019;s investigation. But witnesses had different recollections of the precise
content of those outreaches. Some ODNI officials recalled that Coats told them
immediately after the March 22 Oval Office meeting that the President asked
Coats to intervene with Comey and ”stop” the investigation. But the first-hand
witnesses to the encounter remember the conversation differently. Pompeo had
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
no memory of the specific meeting, but generally recalled the President urging
officials to get the word out that the President had not done anything wrong
related to Russia. Coats recalled that the President asked that Coats state publicly
that no link existed between the President and Russia, but did not ask him to
speak with Comey or to help end the investigation. The other outreaches by the
President during this period were similar in nature. The President asked Rogers if he
could do anything to refute the stories linking the President to Russia, and the
President asked Comey to make a public statement that would ”lift the cloud” of the
ongoing investigation by making clear that the President was not personally under
investigation. These requests, while significant enough that Rogers thought it
important to document the encounter in a written memorandum, were not interpreted
by the officials who received them as directives to improperly interfere with the
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1482--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to a proceeding.</span> At the time of the President&#x2019;s outreaches to leaders of the
intelligence agencies in late March and early April 2017, the FBI&#x2019;s Russia investigation did
not yet involve grand jury proceedings. The outreaches, however, came after and were in
response to Comey&#x2019;s March 20, 2017 announcement that the FBI, as a part of its
counterintelligence mission, was conducting an investigation into Russian interference in
the 2016 presidential election. Comey testified that the investigation included any links or
coordination with Trump campaign officials and would ”include an assessment of whether
any crimes were committed.”
</p><!--l. 1487--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> As described above, the evidence does not establish that the President asked or
directed intelligence agency leaders to stop or interfere with the FBI&#x2019;s Russia
investigation—and the President affirmatively told Comey that if ”some satellite” was
involved in Russian election interference ”it would be good to find that out.” But the
President&#x2019;s intent in trying to prevent Sessions&#x2019;s recusal, and in reaching out to Coats,
Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey following Comey&#x2019;s public announcement of the FBI&#x2019;s Russia
investigation, is nevertheless relevant to understanding what motivated the President&#x2019;s
other actions towards the investigation.
</p><!--l. 1491--><p class="indent" >   The evidence shows that the President was focused on the Russia investigation&#x2019;s
implications for his presidency—and, specifically, on dispelling any suggestion that he
was under investigation or had links to Russia. In early March, the President
attempted to prevent Sessions&#x2019;s recusal, even after being told that Sessions was
following DOJ conflict-of-interest rules. After Sessions recused, the White House
Counsel&#x2019;s Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions about the matter,
although it is not clear whether that direction was conveyed to the President. The
President continued to raise the issue of Sessions&#x2019;s recusal and, when he had the
opportunity, he pulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse. The President also told
advisors that he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him, the way he
perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents.
The President made statements about being able to direct the course of criminal
investigations, saying words to the effect of, ”You&#x2019;re telling me that Bobby and
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Jack didn&#x2019;t talk about investigations? Or Obama didn&#x2019;t tell Eric Holder who to
investigate?”
</p><!--l. 1499--><p class="indent" >   After Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the FBI&#x2019;s Russia investigation on
March 20, 2017, the President was ”beside himself&#x2019; and expressed anger that Comey did
not issue a statement correcting any misperception that the President himself was
under investigation. The President sought to speak with Acting Attorney General
Boente directly and told McGahn to contact Boente to request that Comey make
a clarifying statement. The President then asked other intelligence community
leaders to make public statements to refute the suggestion that the President had
links to Russia, but the leaders told him they could not publicly comment on the
investigation. On March 30 and April 11, against the advice of White House
advisors who had informed him that any direct contact with the FBI could be
perceived as improper interference in an ongoing investigation, the President
made personal outreaches to Comey asking him to ”lift the cloud” of the Russia
investigation by making public the fact that the President was not personally under
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1504--><p class="indent" >   Evidence indicates that the President was angered by both the existence of the Russia
investigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was
not true based on Comey&#x2019;s representations. The President complained to advisors that if
people thought Russia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had
accomplished.
</p><!--l. 1507--><p class="indent" >   Other evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the
Russia investigation on his ability to govern. The President complained that the
perception that he was under investigation was hurting his ability to conduct
foreign relations, particularly with Russia. The President told Coats he ”can&#x2019;t do
anything with Russia,” he told Rogers that ”the thing with the Russians” was
interfering with his ability to conduct foreign affairs, and he told Comey that ”he was
trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that
difficult.”

public that the President was not under investigation. At the hearing, Comey
declined to answer questions about the scope or subjects of the Russia investigation
and did not state publicly that the President was not under investigation. Two
days later, on May 5, 2017, the President told close aides he was going to fire
Comey, and on May 9, he did so, using his official termination letter to make
public that Comey had on three occasions informed the President that he was
not under investigation. The President decided to fire Comey before receiving
advice or a recommendation from the Department of Justice, but he approved an
initial public account of the termination that attributed it to a recommendation
from the Department of Justice based on Comey&#x2019;s handling of the Clinton email
investigation. After Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resisted attributing the
firing to his recommendation, the President acknowledged that he intended to fire
Comey regardless of the DOJ recommendation and was thinking of the Russia
investigation when he made the decision. The President also told the Russian
Foreign Minister, ”I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut
job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That&#x2019;s taken off…. I&#x2019;m not under
investigation.”

unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The

In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided ”on his own”
to review Comey&#x2019;s performance and that Rosenstein decided ”on his own” to come to the
President on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Comey. When a reporter
indicated that the ”vast majority” of FBI agents supported Comey, Sanders said,
”Look, we&#x2019;ve heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different

<!--l. 1940--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#x2019;s decision to fire Comey, the following evidence is relevant to
the elements of obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 1942--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> The act of firing Comey removed the individual overseeing the FBI&#x2019;s
Russia investigation. The President knew that Comey was personally involved in the
investigation based on Comey&#x2019;s briefing of the Gang of Eight, Comey&#x2019;s March 20, 2017
public testimony about the investigation, and the President&#x2019;s one-on-one conversations
with Comey.
</p><!--l. 1946--><p class="indent" >   Firing Comey would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable
effect of interfering with or impeding the investigation—for example, if the termination
would have the effect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the
President with the opportunity to appoint a director who would take a different
approach to the investigation that the President perceived as more protective of his
personal interests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that issue include whether
the President&#x2019;s actions had the potential to discourage a successor director or
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation. The
President fired Comey abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign,
banned him from the FBI building, and criticized him publicly, calling him a
”showboat” and claiming that the FBI was ”in turmoil” under his leadership. And the
President followed the termination with public statements that were highly critical
of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Comey, the President
referred to the investigation as a ”witch hunt” and asked, ”when does it end?”
Those actions had the potential to affect a successor director&#x2019;s conduct of the
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1953--><p class="indent" >   The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be
to prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation. As a general matter, FBI
investigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the
FBI director. Bannon made a similar point when he told the President that he
could fire the FBI director, but could not fire the FBI. The White House issued
a press statement the day after Comey was fired that said, ”The investigation
would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would
not have ended it.” In addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the
President stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Comey that
the action might prolong the investigation. And the President chose McCabe to
serve as interim director, even though McCabe told the President he had worked
”very closely” with Comey and was part of all the decisions made in the Clinton
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1960--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to a proceeding.</span> The nexus element would be satisfied by evidence showing that
a grand jury proceeding or criminal prosecution arising from an FBI investigation was
objectively foreseeable and actually contemplated by the President when he terminated
Comey.
</p><!--l. 1963--><p class="indent" >   Several facts would be relevant to such as showing. At the time the President fired
Comey, a grand jury had not begun to hear evidence related to the Russia investigation
and no grand jury subpoenas had been issued. On March 20, 2017, however, Comey had
announced that the FBI was investigating Russia&#x2019;s interference in the election, including
”an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.” It was widely known that the FBI,
as part of the Russia investigation, was investigating the hacking of the DNC&#x2019;s
computers—a clear criminal offense.
</p><!--l. 1968--><p class="indent" >   In addition, at the time the President fired Comey, evidence indicates the President
knew that Flynn was still under criminal investigation and could potentially be prosecuted,
despite the President&#x2019;s February 14, 2017 request that Comey ”let[] Flynn go.” On March
5, 2017, the White House Counsel&#x2019;s Office was informed that the FBI was asking for
transition-period records relating to Flynn—indicating that the FBI was still actively
investigating him. The same day, the President told advisors he wanted to call Dana
Boente, then the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation, to find out whether
the White House or the President was being investigated. On March 31, 2017, the
President signaled his awareness that Flynn remained in legal jeopardy by tweeting that
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
”Mike Flynn should ask for immunity” before he agreed to provide testimony to the FBI or
Congress. And in late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a
message to Flynn telling him that the President felt bad for him and that he should
stay strong, further demonstrating the President&#x2019;s awareness of Flynn&#x2019;s criminal
exposure.
</p><!--l. 1974--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President&#x2019;s decision to
fire Comey was Comey&#x2019;s unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not
personally under investigation, despite the President&#x2019;s repeated requests that Comey make
such an announcement. In the week leading up to Comey&#x2019;s May 3, 2017 Senate
Judiciary Committee testimony, the President told McGahn that it would be the last
straw if Comey did not set the record straight and publicly announce that the
President was not under investigation. But during his May 3 testimony, Comey
refused to answer questions about whether the President was being investigated.
Comey&#x2019;s refusal angered the President, who criticized Sessions for leaving him
isolated and exposed, saying ”You left me on an island.” Two days later, the
President told advisors he had decided to fire Comey and dictated a letter to
Stephen Miller that began with a reference to the fact that the President was not
being investigated: ”While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not
under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a
Trump-Russia relationship….” The President later asked Rosenstein to include ”Russia” in
his memorandum and to say that Comey had told the President that he was
not under investigation. And the President&#x2019;s final termination letter included a
sentence, at the President&#x2019;s insistence and against McGahn&#x2019;s advice, stating that
Comey had told the President on three separate occasions that he was not under
investigation.
</p><!--l. 1984--><p class="indent" >   The President&#x2019;s other stated rationales for why he fired Comey are not similarly
supported by the evidence. The termination letter the President and Stephen Miller
prepared in Bedminster cited Comey&#x2019;s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the
President told McCabe he fired Comey for that reason. But the facts surrounding Comey&#x2019;s
handling of the Clinton email investigation were well known to the President at the
time he assumed office, and the President had made it clear to both Comey and
the President&#x2019;s senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted Comey to stay on as
director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Comey&#x2019;s handling of the Clinton
investigation after the President had already decided to fire Comey. The President&#x2019;s
draft termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time
low and Sanders told the press after Comey&#x2019;s termination that the White House
had heard from ”countless” FBI agents who had lost confidence in Comey. But
the evidence does not support those claims. The President told Comey at their
January 27 dinner that ”the people of the FBI really like [him],” no evidence
suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Comey, and
Sanders acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on
anything.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 1992--><p class="indent" >   We also considered why it was important to the President that Comey announce
publicly that he was not under investigation. Some evidence indicates that the President
believed that the erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to
manage domestic and foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia. The President
told Comey that the ”cloud” of ”this Russia business” was making it difficult to run the
country. The President told Sessions and McGahn that foreign leaders had expressed
sympathy to him for being under investigation and that the perception he was under
investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues. The President
complained to Rogers that ”the thing with the Russians [was] messing up” his ability to
get things done with Russia, and told Coats, ”I can&#x2019;t do anything with Russia,
there&#x2019;s things I&#x2019;d like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they&#x2019;re all over me
with this.” The President also may have viewed Comey as insubordinate for his
failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that the President was not under
investigation.
</p><!--l. 2000--><p class="indent" >   Other evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself
from an investigation into his campaign. The day after learning about the FBI&#x2019;s
interview of Flynn, the President had a one-on-one dinner with Comey, against the
advice of senior aides, and told Comey he needed Comey&#x2019;s ”loyalty.” When the
President later asked Comey for a second time to make public that he was not under
investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying ”Because I have been very loyal
to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.” After the President learned
of Sessions&#x2019;s recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious
and said he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him the way he
perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents. The
President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney General ”who to
investigate.”
</p><!--l. 2006--><p class="indent" >   In addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI&#x2019;s Russia investigation behind
him. The evidence does not establish that the termination of Comey was designed to cover
up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the
evidence uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close
to him were involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure
conspiracies, or that the President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any
Russian official. But the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation
would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the
President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and
political concerns. Although the President publicly stated during and after the
election that he had no connection to Russia, the Trump Organization, through
Michael Cohen, was pursuing the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project through
June 2016 and candidate Trump was repeatedly briefed on the progress of those
efforts.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn498x0" id="fn498x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">498</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-52096f498"></a>
In addition, some witnesses said that Trump was aware that <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________ _________</span> at a
time when public reports stated that Russian intelligence officials were behind the
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
hacks, and that Trump privately sought information about future WikiLeaks
releases.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn499x0" id="fn499x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">499</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-52097f499"></a>
More broadly, multiple witnesses described the President&#x2019;s preoccupation with press coverage of the
Russia investigation and his persistent concern that it raised questions about the legitimacy of his
election.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn500x0" id="fn500x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">500</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-52098f500"></a>
</p><!--l. 2021--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the President and White House aides initially advanced a pretextual reason to
the press and the public for Comey&#x2019;s termination. In the immediate aftermath of the firing,
the President dictated a press statement suggesting that he had acted based on the
DOJ recommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story. But
the President had decided to fire Comey before the White House solicited those
recommendations. Although the President ultimately acknowledged that he was going to
fire Comey regardless of the Department of Justice&#x2019;s recommendations, he did so only
after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would resist the White House&#x2019;s
suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Comey&#x2019;s termination. The
initial reliance on a pretextual justification could support an inference that the
President had concerns about providing the real reason for the firing, although
the evidence does not resolve whether those concerns were personal, political, or
both.

<!--l. 2033--><p class="noindent" >The Acting Attorney General appointed a Special Counsel on May 17, 2017,
prompting the President to state that it was the end of his presidency and that
Attorney General Sessions had failed to protect him and should resign. Sessions
submitted his resignation, which the President ultimately did not accept. The
President told senior advisors that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest, but
they responded that those claims were ”ridiculous” and posed no obstacle to the
Special Counsel&#x2019;s service. Department of Justice ethics officials similarly cleared the
Special Counsel&#x2019;s service. On June 14, 2017, the press reported that the President
was being personally investigated for obstruction of justice and the President
responded with a series of tweets criticizing the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation. That
weekend, the President called McGahn and directed him to have the Special
Counsel removed because of asserted conflicts of interest. McGahn did not carry
out the instruction for fear of being seen as triggering another Saturday Night
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Massacre and instead prepared to resign. McGahn ultimately did not quit and the
President did not follow up with McGahn on his request to have the Special Counsel
removed.

staff.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Priebus recalled that McGahn said that the President had asked him to ”do crazy shit,”
but he thought McGahn did not tell him the specifics of the President&#x2019;s request
because McGahn was trying to protect Priebus from what he did not need to
know.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn596x0" id="fn596x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">596</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-56036f596"></a>
Priebus and Bannon both urged McGahn not to quit, and McGahn
ultimately returned to work that Monday and remained in his
position.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn597x0" id="fn597x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">597</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-56037f597"></a>
He had not told the President directly that he planned to resign, and when they next saw

Rosenstein.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 2373--><p class="indent" >   Around the same time, Chris Christie recalled a telephone call with the President in

<!--l. 2386--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#x2019;s direction to McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed,
the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 2388--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> As with the President&#x2019;s firing of Comey, the attempt to remove the
Special Counsel would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the
investigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.
Even if the removal of the lead prosecutor would not prevent the investigation
from continuing under a new appointee, a fact finder would need to consider
whether the act had the potential to delay further action in the investigation,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel, or otherwise impede the
investigation.
</p><!--l. 2392--><p class="indent" >   A threshold question is whether the President in fact directed McGahn to have the
Special Counsel removed. After news organizations reported that in June 2017
the President had ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the
President publicly disputed these accounts, and privately told McGahn that he
had simply wanted McGahn to bring conflicts of interest to the Department of
Justice&#x2019;s attention. See Volume II, Section III, <span 
class="cmti-12">infra</span>. Some of the President&#x2019;s specific
language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with that explanation.
Substantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went
further and in fact directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel
removed.
</p><!--l. 2399--><p class="indent" >   First, McGahn&#x2019;s clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell
Rosenstein not only that conflicts existed but also that ”Mueller has to go.” McGahn is a
credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White
House.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn601x0" id="fn601x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">601</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-56041f601"></a>
McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both
times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President&#x2019;s request. In
response to that request, McGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in
events that he described as akin to the Saturday Night Massacre. He called his lawyer,
drove to the White House, packed up his office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with
his chief of staff, told Priebus that the President had asked him to ”do crazy shit,”
and informed Priebus and Bannon that he was leaving. Those acts would be a
highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of
Justice.
</p><!--l. 2408--><p class="indent" >   Second, in the days before the calls to McGahn, the President, through his counsel, had
already brought the asserted conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice.
Accordingly, the President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to
raise conflicts issues that already had been raised.
</p><!--l. 2411--><p class="indent" >   Third, the President&#x2019;s sense of urgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take
immediate action on a weekend—”You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.” - support
McGahn&#x2019;s recollection that the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action
to remove the Special Counsel. Had the President instead sought only to have the
Department of Justice re-examine asserted conflicts to evaluate whether they posed an
ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to set the process in motion on a Saturday and
to make repeated calls to McGahn.
</p><!--l. 2416--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the President had discussed ”knocking out Mueller” and raised conflicts of
interest in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the
conflicts to a plan to remove the Special Counsel. And in the days leading up to June 17,
2017, the President made clear to Priebus and Bannon, who then told Ruddy, that the
President was considering terminating the Special Counsel. Also during this time period,
the President reached out to Christie to get his thoughts on firing the Special Counsel. This
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
evidence shows that the President was not just seeking an examination of whether conflicts
existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a way to terminate the Special
Counsel.
</p><!--l. 2421--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> To satisfy the proceeding requirement, it would be
necessary to establish a nexus between the President&#x2019;s act of seeking to terminate the
Special Counsel and a pending or foreseeable grand jury proceeding.
</p><!--l. 2424--><p class="indent" >   Substantial evidence indicates that by June 17, 2017, the President knew his conduct
was under investigation by a federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of
federal crimes to a grand jury. On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly warned the
President that his ”biggest exposure” was not his act of firing Comey but his
”other contacts” and ”calls,” and his ”ask re: Flynn.” By early June, it was widely
reported in the media that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas
in the Flynn inquiry and that the Special Counsel had taken over the Flynn
investigation.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn602x0" id="fn602x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">602</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-56042f602"></a>
On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office informed the White House that investigators
would be interviewing intelligence agency officials who allegedly had been asked by the
President to push back against the Russia investigation. On June 14, 2017, news outlets
began reporting that the President was himself being investigated for obstruction of justice.
Based on widespread reporting, the President knew that such an investigation could
include his request for Comey&#x2019;s loyalty; his request that Comey ”let[] Flynn go”; his
outreach to Coats and Rogers; and his termination of Comey and statement to
the Russian Foreign Minister that the termination had relieved ”great pressure”
related to Russia. And on June 16, 2017, the day before he directed McGahn to
have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly acknowledged that his
conduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor, tweeting, ”I am being
investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI
Director!”
</p><!--l. 2437--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Substantial evidence indicates that the President&#x2019;s attempts to remove the
Special Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel&#x2019;s oversight of investigations that
involved the President&#x2019;s conduct—and, most immediately, to reports that the President
was being investigated for potential obstruction of justice.
</p><!--l. 2440--><p class="indent" >   Before the President terminated Comey, the President considered it critically important
that he was not under investigation and that the public not erroneously think he was being
investigated. As described in Volume II, Section II.D, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>, advisors perceived the
President, while he was drafting the Comey termination letter, to be concerned more than
anything else about getting out that he was not personally under investigation. When the
President learned of the appointment of the Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed
further concern about the investigation, saying ”[t]his is the end of my Presidency.” The
President also faulted Sessions for recusing, saying ”you were supposed to protect
me.”
</p><!--l. 2445--><p class="indent" >   On June 14, 2017, when the Washington Post reported that the Special Counsel was
investigating the President for obstruction of justice, the President was facing what he had
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
wanted to avoid: a criminal investigation into his own conduct that was the subject of
widespread media attention. The evidence indicates that news of the obstruction
investigation prompted the President to call McGahn and seek to have the Special Counsel
removed. By mid-June, the Department of Justice had already cleared the Special
Counsel&#x2019;s service and the President&#x2019;s advisors had told him that the claimed conflicts of
interest were ”silly” and did not provide a basis to remove the Special Counsel. On June
13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before Congress that no good cause
for removing the Special Counsel existed, and the President dictated a press
statement to Sanders saying he had no intention of firing the Special Counsel. But
the next day, the media reported that the President was under investigation for
obstruction of justice and the Special Counsel was interviewing witnesses about
events related to possible obstruction—spurring the President to write critical
tweets about the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation. The President called McGahn
at home that night and then called him on Saturday from Camp David. The
evidence accordingly indicates that news that an obstruction investigation had been
opened is what led the President to call McGahn to have the Special Counsel
terminated.
</p><!--l. 2453--><p class="indent" >   There also is evidence that the President knew that he should not have made those calls
to McGahn. The President made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told
the President that the White House Counsel&#x2019;s Office—and McGahn himself—could not be
involved in pressing conflicts claims and that the President should consult with his personal
counsel if he wished to raise conflicts. Instead of relying on his personal counsel to
submit the conflicts claims, the President sought to use his official powers to
remove the Special Counsel. And after the media reported on the President&#x2019;s
actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel
terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story, as discussed in
Volume II, Section III, <span 
class="cmti-12">infra</span>. Those denials are contrary to the evidence and
suggest the President&#x2019;s awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as
improper.

19, 2017, the President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and
dictated a message to be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have had the
effect of limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference only. One month
later, the President met again with Lewandowski and followed up on the request to have
Sessions limit the scope of the Russia investigation. Lewandowski told the President the
message would be delivered soon. Hours later, the President publicly criticized
Sessions in an unplanned press interview, raising questions about Sessions&#x2019;s job
security.

Sessions&#x2019;s recusal, the President said, was ”very unfair to the president. How
do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself
before the job, I would have said, &#x2019;Thanks, Jeff, but I can&#x2019;t, you know, I&#x2019;m

Priebus had previously talked to Hunt when the media had reported on tensions between Sessions

Although the President tied his desire for Sessions to resign to Sessions&#x2019;s negative press and
poor performance in congressional testimony, Priebus believed that the President&#x2019;s desire to
replace Sessions was driven by the President&#x2019;s hatred of Sessions&#x2019;s recusal from the Russia

<!--l. 2680--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#x2019;s efforts to have Lewandowski deliver a message directing
Sessions to publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to
future election interference, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction
of justice:
</p><!--l. 2682--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> The President&#x2019;s effort to send Sessions a message through Lewandowski
would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the investigation and any
grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.
</p><!--l. 2685--><p class="indent" >   The President sought to have Sessions announce that the President ”shouldn&#x2019;t have a
Special Prosecutor/Counsel” and that Sessions was going to ”meet with the Special
Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with
investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in
future elections.” The President wanted Sessions to disregard his recusal from the
investigation, which had followed from a formal DOJ ethics review, and have
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Sessions declare that he knew ”for a fact” that ”there were no Russians involved
with the campaign” because he ”was there.” The President further directed that
Sessions should explain that the President should not be subject to an investigation
”because he hasn&#x2019;t done anything wrong.” Taken together, the President&#x2019;s directives
indicate that Sessions was being instructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the
existing investigation into the President and his campaign, with the Special Counsel
being permitted to ”move forward with investigating election meddling for future
elections.”
</p><!--l. 2690--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> As described above, by the time of the President&#x2019;s
initial one-on-one meeting with Lewandowski on June 19, 2017, the existence of a grand
jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. By the time of
the President&#x2019;s follow-up meeting with Lewandowski, <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________ _________</span> See
Volume II, Section II.G, <span 
class="cmti-12">infra</span>. To satisfy the nexus requirement, it would be necessary to
show that limiting the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation would have the natural and probable
effect of impeding that grand jury proceeding.
</p><!--l. 2696--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Substantial evidence indicates that the President&#x2019;s effort to have Sessions limit
the scope of the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation to future election interference was intended
to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President&#x2019;s and his campaign&#x2019;s
conduct.
</p><!--l. 2699--><p class="indent" >   As previously described, see Volume II, Section II.B, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>, the President knew that
the Russia investigation was focused in part on his campaign, and he perceived allegations
of Russian interference to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election. The President
further knew that the investigation had broadened to include his own conduct
and whether he had obstructed justice. Those investigations would not proceed
if the Special Counsel&#x2019;s jurisdiction were limited to future election interference
only.
</p><!--l. 2703--><p class="indent" >   The timing and circumstances of the President&#x2019;s actions support the conclusion that he
sought that result. The President&#x2019;s initial direction that Sessions should limit
the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation came just two days after the President had
ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, which itself followed public
reports that the President was personally under investigation for obstruction of
justice. The sequence of those events raises an inference that after seeking to
terminate the Special Counsel, the President sought to exclude his and his campaign&#x2019;s
conduct from the investigation&#x2019;s scope. The President raised the matter with
Lewandowski again on July 19, 2017, just days after emails and information about
the June 9, 2016 meeting between Russians and senior campaign officials had
been publicly disclosed, generating substantial media coverage and investigative
interest.
</p><!--l. 2708--><p class="indent" >   The manner in which the President acted provides additional evidence of his intent.
Rather than rely on official channels, the President met with Lewandowski alone in the
Oval Office. The President selected a loyal ”devotee” outside the White House to deliver
the message, supporting an inference that he was working outside White House channels,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
including McGahn, who had previously resisted contacting the Department of Justice
about the Special Counsel. The President also did not contact the Acting Attorney
General, who had just testified publicly that there was no cause to remove the Special
Counsel. Instead, the President tried to use Sessions to restrict and redirect the Special
Counsel&#x2019;s investigation when Sessions was recused and could not properly take any action
on it.
</p><!--l. 2714--><p class="indent" >   The July 19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the President&#x2019;s intent. The
President followed up with Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one
month after he first dictated the message for Sessions, demonstrating he still
sought to pursue the request. And just hours after Lewandowski assured the
President that the message would soon be delivered to Sessions, the President gave
an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he publicly attacked
Sessions and raised questions about his job security. Four days later, on July
22, 2017, the President directed Priebus to obtain Sessions&#x2019;s resignation. That
evidence could raise an inference that the President wanted Sessions to realize
that his job might be on the line as he evaluated whether to comply with the
President&#x2019;s direction that Sessions publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal,
he was going to confine the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation to future election
interference.

<!--l. 2970--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#x2019;s actions regarding the disclosure of information about the
June 9 meeting, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of
justice:
</p><!--l. 2972--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> On at least three occasions between June 29, 2017, and July 9, 2017,
the President directed Hicks and others not to publicly disclose information about the
June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian attorney.
On June 29, Hicks warned the President that the emails setting up the June 9
meeting were ”really bad” and the story would be ”massive” when it broke, but the
President told her and Kushner to ”leave it alone.” Early on July 8, after Hicks told
the President the New York Times was working on a story about the June 9
meeting, the President directed her not to comment, even though Hicks said that the
President usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Later that day, the President rejected Trump Jr.&#x2019;s draft statement that would
have acknowledged that the meeting was with ”an individual who I was told
might have information helpful to the campaign.” The President then dictated a
statement to Hicks that said the meeting was about Russian adoption (which
the President had twice been told was discussed at the meeting). The statement
dictated by the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about
Clinton.
</p><!--l. 2979--><p class="indent" >   Each of these efforts by the President involved his communications team and was
directed at the press. They would amount to obstructive acts only if the President, by
taking these actions, sought to withhold information from or mislead congressional
investigators or the Special Counsel. On May 17, 2017, the President&#x2019;s campaign received a
document request from SSCI that clearly covered the June 9 meeting and underlying
emails, and those documents also plainly would have been relevant to the Special Counsel&#x2019;s
investigation.
</p><!--l. 2983--><p class="indent" >   But the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails
or other information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the
Special Counsel. The series of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to
the emails and prevent their public release occurred in the context of developing a press
strategy. The only evidence we have of the President discussing the production of
documents to Congress or the Special Counsel is the conversation on June 29, 2017, when
Hicks recalled the President acknowledging that Kushner&#x2019;s attorney should provide emails
related to the June 9 meeting to whomever he needed to give them to. We do
not have evidence of what the President discussed with his own lawyers at that
time.
</p><!--l. 2988--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> As described above, by the time of the President&#x2019;s
attempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting,
the existence of a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel
was public knowledge, and the President had been told that the emails were
responsive to congressional inquiries. To satisfy the nexus requirement, however,
it would be necessary to show that preventing the release of the emails to the
public would have the natural and probable effect of impeding the grand jury
proceeding or congressional inquiries. As noted above, the evidence does not establish
that the President sought to prevent disclosure of the emails in those official
proceedings.
</p><!--l. 2993--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> The evidence establishes the President&#x2019;s substantial involvement in the
communications strategy related to information about his campaign&#x2019;s connections to
Russia and his desire to minimize public disclosures about those connections. The
President became aware of the emails no later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them
with Hicks and Kushner, and he could have been aware of them as early as June 2, 2017,
when lawyers for the Trump Organization began interviewing witnesses who participated in
the June 9 meeting. The President thereafter repeatedly rejected the advice of
Hicks and other staffers to publicly release information about the June 9 meeting.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
The President expressed concern that multiple people had access to the emails
and instructed Hicks that only one lawyer should deal with the matter. And
the President dictated a statement to be released by Trump Jr. in response to
the first press accounts of the June 9 meeting that said the meeting was about
adoption.
</p><!--l. 3000--><p class="indent" >   But as described above, the evidence does not establish that the President intended to
prevent the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office or Congress from obtaining the emails setting up
the June 9 meeting or other information about that meeting. The statement
recorded by Corallo—that the emails ”will never get out”—can be explained as
reflecting a belief that the emails would not be made public if the President&#x2019;s press
strategy were followed, even if the emails were provided to Congress and the Special
Counsel.

additional steps to have Sessions reverse his recusal. In particular, at some point

According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that
Sessions could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary

Sessions to unrecuse from ”all of it,” including the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Russia

<!--l. 3169--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#x2019;s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse himself and regain control
of the Russia investigation, the following considerations and evidence are relevant to the
elements of obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 3171--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> To determine if the President&#x2019;s efforts to have the Attorney General
unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on
whether those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would
take into account the supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play
in the Russia investigation. It also would have to take into account that the Attorney
General&#x2019;s recusal covered other campaign-related matters. The inquiry would not turn on
what Attorney General Sessions would actually do if unrecused, but on whether the efforts
to reverse his recusal would naturally have had the effect of impeding the Russia
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
investigation.
</p><!--l. 3177--><p class="indent" >   On multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his
recusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation and
prosecution of Hillary Clinton. For example, in early summer 2017, Sessions recalled the
President asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did not take it as a directive. When the
President raised the issue again in December 2017, the President said, as recorded by
Porter, ”Not telling you to do anything…. I&#x2019;m not going to get involved. I&#x2019;m not going to do
anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.” The duration of the
President&#x2019;s efforts—which spanned from March 2017 to August 2018—and the
fact that the President repeatedly criticized Sessions in public and in private for
failing to tell the President that he would have to recuse is relevant to assessing
whether the President&#x2019;s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as obstructive
acts.
</p><!--l. 3185--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> As described above, by mid-June 2017, the existence of a
grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. In addition,
in July 2017, a different grand jury supervised by the Special Counsel was empaneled in the
District of Columbia, and the press reported on the existence of this grand jury in early August
2017.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn776x0" id="fn776x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">776</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-69025f776"></a>
Whether the conduct towards the Attorney General would have a foreseeable impact on
those proceedings turns on much of the same evidence discussed above with respect to the
obstructive-act element.
</p><!--l. 3192--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President&#x2019;s conduct toward
Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and
supervise it in a way that would restrict its scope. By the summer of 2017, the
President was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating him personally
for obstruction of justice. And in the wake of the disclosures of emails about
the June 9 meeting between Russians and senior members of the campaign, see
Volume II, Section II.G, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>, it was evident that the investigation into the
campaign now included the President&#x2019;s son, son-in-law, and former campaign
manager. The President had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions
publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to
future election interference. Yet Sessions remained recused. In December 2017,
shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to Sessions in the Oval
Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if he
unrecused. Porter linked that request to the President&#x2019;s desire that Sessions take
back supervision of the Russia investigation and direct an investigation of Hillary
Clinton. The President said in that meeting that he ”just want[ed] to be treated
fairly,” which could reflect his perception that it was unfair that he was being
investigated while Hillary Clinton was not. But a principal effect of that act would be to
restore supervision of the Russia investigation to the Attorney General—a position
that the President frequently suggested should be occupied by someone like Eric
Holder and Bobby Kennedy, who the President described as protecting their
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
presidents. A reasonable inference from those statements and the President&#x2019;s
actions is that the President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would
play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia
investigation.

McGahn to have the Special Counsel fired based on purported conflicts of interest but
McGahn had refused, saying he would quit instead. After the story broke, the
President, through his personal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn
deny that he had been directed to remove the Special Counsel. Each time he was
approached, McGahn responded that he would not refute the press accounts
because they were accurate in reporting on the President&#x2019;s effort to have the
Special Counsel removed. The President later personally met with McGahn in
the Oval Office with only the Chief of Staff present and tried to get McGahn to
say that the President never ordered him to fire the Special Counsel. McGahn
refused and insisted his memory of the President&#x2019;s direction to remove the Special
Counsel was accurate. In that same meeting, the President challenged McGahn for
taking notes of his discussions with the President and asked why he had told
Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel
removed.

<!--l. 3403--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#x2019;s efforts to have McGahn deny that he had been ordered to
have the Special Counsel removed, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of
obstruction of justice:
</p><!--l. 3405--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> The President&#x2019;s repeated efforts to get McGahn to create a record
denying that the President had directed him to remove the Special Counsel would
qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural tendency to constrain McGahn
from testifying truthfully or to undermine his credibility as a potential witness
if he testified consistently with his memory, rather than with what the record
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
said.
</p><!--l. 3408--><p class="indent" >   There is some evidence that at the time the New York Times and Washington Post
stories were published in late January 2018, the President believed the stories were wrong
and that he had never told McGahn to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. The
President correctly understood that McGahn had not told the President directly that he
planned to resign. In addition, the President told Priebus and Porter that he had not
sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and in the Oval Office meeting with McGahn, the
President said, ”I never said to fire Mueller. I never said &#x2019;fire.”” That evidence
could indicate that the President was not attempting to persuade McGahn to
change his story but was instead offering his own—but different—recollection of the
substance of his June 2017 conversations with McGahn and McGahn&#x2019;s reaction to
them.
</p><!--l. 3414--><p class="indent" >   Other evidence cuts against that understanding of the President&#x2019;s conduct. As
previously described, see Volume II, Section III, <span 
class="cmti-12">supra</span>, substantial evidence supports
McGahn&#x2019;s account that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel
removed, including the timing and context of the President&#x2019;s directive; the manner in which
McGahn reacted; and the fact that the President had been told the conflicts
were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department of Justice, and
should be raised with the President&#x2019;s personal counsel rather than brought to
McGahn. In addition, the President&#x2019;s subsequent denials that he had told McGahn
to have the Special Counsel removed were carefully worded. When first asked
about the New York Times story, the President said, ”Fake news, folks. Fake
news. A typical New York Times fake story.” And when the President spoke with
McGahn in the Oval Office, he focused on whether he had used the word ”fire,”
saying, ”I never said to fire Mueller. I never said &#x2019;fire&#x2019;” and ”Did I say the word
&#x2019;fire&#x2019;?” The President&#x2019;s assertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never
directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed thus runs counter to the
evidence.
</p><!--l. 3424--><p class="indent" >   In addition, even if the President sincerely disagreed with McGahn&#x2019;s memory of the
June 17, 2017 events, the evidence indicates that the President knew by the time of the
Oval Office meeting that McGahn&#x2019;s account differed and that McGahn was firm in his
views. Shortly after the story broke, the President&#x2019;s counsel told McGahn&#x2019;s counsel that
the President wanted McGahn to make a statement denying he had been asked to fire the
Special Counsel, but McGahn responded through his counsel that that aspect of the story
was accurate and he therefore could not comply with the President&#x2019;s request.
The President then directed Sanders to tell McGahn to correct the story, but
McGahn told her he would not do so because the story was accurate in reporting
on the President&#x2019;s order. Consistent with that position, McGahn never issued a
correction. More than a week later, the President brought up the issue again with
Porter, made comments indicating the President thought McGahn had leaked
the story, and directed Porter to have McGahn create a record denying that the
President had tried to fire the Special Counsel. At that point, the President said he
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
might ”have to get rid of&#x2019; McGahn if McGahn did not comply. McGahn again
refused and told Porter, as he had told Sanders and as his counsel had told the
President&#x2019;s counsel, that the President had in fact ordered him to have Rosenstein
remove the Special Counsel. That evidence indicates that by the time of the
Oval Office meeting the President was aware that McGahn did not think the
story was false and did not want to issue a statement or create a written record
denying facts that McGahn believed to be true. The President nevertheless persisted
and asked McGahn to repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were
accurate.
</p><!--l. 3435--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> By January 2018, the Special Counsel&#x2019;s use of a grand
jury had been further confirmed by the return of several indictments. The President also
was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating obstruction-related events
because, among other reasons, on January 8, 2018, the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office
provided his counsel with a detailed list of topics for a possible interview with the
President.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn830x0" id="fn830x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">830</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-72047f830"></a>
The President knew that McGahn had personal knowledge of many of the events the
Special Counsel was investigating and that McGahn had already been interviewed by
Special Counsel investigators. And in the Oval Office meeting, the President indicated he
knew that McGahn had told the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office about the President&#x2019;s effort to
remove the Special Counsel. The President challenged McGahn for disclosing that
information and for taking notes that he viewed as creating unnecessary legal exposure.
That evidence indicates the President&#x2019;s awareness that the June 17, 2017 events were
relevant to the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation and any grand jury investigation that might
grow out of it.
</p><!--l. 3445--><p class="indent" >   To establish a nexus, it would be necessary to show that the President&#x2019;s actions would
have the natural tendency to affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay, or
prevent the communication of information to investigators. Because McGahn had
spoken to Special Counsel investigators before January 2018, the President could
not have been seeking to influence his prior statements in those interviews. But
because McGahn had repeatedly spoken to investigators and the obstruction
inquiry was not complete, it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again on
obstruction-related topics. If the President were focused solely on a press strategy in
seeking to have McGahn refute the New York Times article, a nexus to a proceeding or to
further investigative interviews would not be shown. But the President&#x2019;s efforts to
have McGahn write a letter ”for our records” approximately ten days after the
stories had come out—well past the typical time to issue a correction for a news
story—indicates the President was not focused solely on a press strategy, but instead
likely contemplated the ongoing investigation and any proceedings arising from
it.
</p><!--l. 3451--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute that
he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose
of influencing McGahn&#x2019;s account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
President&#x2019;s conduct towards the investigation.
</p><!--l. 3454--><p class="indent" >   inquiry. Several facts support that conclusion. The President made repeated
attempts to get McGahn to change his story. As described above, by the time
of the last attempt, the evidence suggests that the President had been told on
multiple occasions that McGahn believed the President had ordered him to have the
Special Counsel terminated. McGahn interpreted his encounter with the President
in the Oval Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he
was to his memory of what had occurred. The President had already laid the
groundwork for pressing McGahn to alter his account by telling Porter that it might
be necessary to fire McGahn if he did not deny the story, and Porter relayed
that statement to McGahn. Additional evidence of the President&#x2019;s intent may be
gleaned from the fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed by the prospect
of the President&#x2019;s meeting with McGahn that he called McGahn&#x2019;s counsel and
said that McGahn could not resign no matter what happened in the Oval Office
that day. The President&#x2019;s counsel was well aware of McGahn&#x2019;s resolve not to
issue what he believed to be a false account of events despite the President&#x2019;s
request. Finally, as noted above, the President brought up the Special Counsel
investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGahn and criticized him for telling
this Office about the June 17, 2017 events. The President&#x2019;s statements reflect
his understanding—and his displeasure—that those events would be part of an
obstruction-of-justice

<!--l. 3781--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing the President&#x2019;s conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, <span class="redacted">________ ___ _____________</span>
<span class="redacted">_____________</span>, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of
justice:
</p><!--l. 3783--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Obstructive act.</span> The President&#x2019;s actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel&#x2019;s
investigation would qualify as obstructive if they had the natural tendency to
prevent particular witnesses from testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have
the probable effect of influencing, delaying, or preventing their testimony to law
enforcement.
</p><!--l. 3786--><p class="indent" >   With regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn
encouraging him to stay strong and conveying that the President still cared about him
before he began to cooperate with the government. When Flynn&#x2019;s attorneys withdrew him
from a joint defense agreement with the President, signaling that Flynn was potentially
cooperating with the government, the President&#x2019;s personal counsel initially reminded
Flynn&#x2019;s counsel of the President&#x2019;s warm feelings towards Flynn and said ”that still
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
remains.” But when Flynn&#x2019;s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer share
information under a joint defense agreement, the President&#x2019;s personal counsel stated
that the decision would be interpreted as reflecting Flynn&#x2019;s hostility towards the
President. That sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn&#x2019;s
decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege
issues, however, we could not determine whether the President was personally
involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn&#x2019;s
counsel.
</p><!--l. 3792--><p class="indent" >   With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President&#x2019;s actions had the
potential to influence Manafort&#x2019;s decision whether to cooperate with the government.
The President and his personal counsel made repeated statements suggesting
that a pardon was a possibility for Manafort, while also making it clear that the
President did not want Manafort to ”flip” and cooperate with the government.
On June 15, 2018, the day the judge presiding over Manafort&#x2019;s D.C. case was
considering whether to revoke his bail, the President said that he ”felt badly” for
Manafort and stated, ”I think a lot of it is very unfair.” And when asked about a
pardon for Manafort, the President said, ”I do want to see people treated fairly.
That&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s all about.” Later that day, after Manafort&#x2019;s bail was revoked, the
President called it a ”tough sentence” that was ”Very unfair!” Two days later,
the President&#x2019;s personal counsel stated that individuals involved in the Special
Counsel&#x2019;s investigation could receive a pardon ”if in fact the [P]resident and his
advisors … come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly”&#x2019;—using
language that paralleled how the President had already described the treatment of
Manafort. Those statements, combined with the President&#x2019;s commendation of
Manafort for being a ”brave man” who ”refused to” break&#x2019;,” suggested that a
pardon was a more likely possibility if Manafort continued not to cooperate with
the government. And while Manafort eventually pleaded guilty pursuant to a
cooperation agreement, he was found to have violated the agreement by lying to
investigators.
</p><!--l. 3801--><p class="indent" >   The President&#x2019;s public statements during the Manafort trial, including during jury
deliberations, also had the potential to influence the trial jury. On the second day of
trial, for example, the President called the prosecution a ”terrible situation” and
a ”hoax” that ”continues to stain our country” and referred to Manafort as a
”Reagan/Dole darling” who was ”serving solitary confinement” even though he was
”convicted of nothing.” Those statements were widely picked up by the press.
While jurors were instructed not to watch or read news stories about the case
and are presumed to follow those instructions, the President&#x2019;s statements during
the trial generated substantial media coverage that could have reached jurors if
they happened to see the statements or learned about them from others. And
the President&#x2019;s statements during jury deliberations that Manafort ”happens
to be a very good person” and that ”it&#x2019;s very sad what they&#x2019;ve done to Paul
Manafort” had the potential to influence jurors who learned of the statements, which
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
the President made just as jurors were considering whether to convict or acquit
Manafort.
</p><!--l. 3807--><p class="indent" >   <span class="redacted">______ __ ________ _____________</span>
</p><!--l. 3809--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> The President&#x2019;s actions towards Flynn, Manafort,
appear to have been connected to pending or anticipated official proceedings
involving each individual. The President&#x2019;s conduct towards Flynn principally
occurred when both were under criminal investigation by the Special Counsel&#x2019;s
Office and press reports speculated about whether they would cooperate with the
Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation. And the President&#x2019;s conduct towards Manafort was
directly connected to the official proceedings involving him. The President made
statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort&#x2019;s criminal
trial. And the President&#x2019;s comments about the prospect of Manafort ”flipping”
occurred when it was clear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury
proceedings.
</p><!--l. 3816--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> Evidence concerning the President&#x2019;s intent related to Flynn as a potential
witness is inconclusive. As previously noted, because of privilege issues we do not have
evidence establishing whether the President knew about or was involved in his counsel&#x2019;s
communications with Flynn&#x2019;s counsel stating that Flynn&#x2019;s decision to withdraw from the
joint defense agreement and cooperate with the government would be viewed as reflecting
”hostility” towards the President. And regardless of what the President&#x2019;s personal counsel
communicated, the President continued to express sympathy for Flynn after he pleaded
guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, stating that Flynn had ”led a very
strong life” and the President ”fe[lt] very badly” about what had happened to
him.
</p><!--l. 3821--><p class="indent" >   Evidence concerning the President&#x2019;s conduct towards Manafort indicates that the
President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government. Before
Manafort was convicted, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort had been treated
unfairly. One day after Manafort was convicted on eight felony charges and potentially
faced a lengthy prison term, the President said that Manafort was ”a brave man” for
refusing to ”break” and that ”flipping” ”almost ought to be outlawed.” At the same time,
although the President had privately told aides he did not like Manafort, he publicly called
Manafort ”a good man” and said he had a ”wonderful family.” And when the President
was asked whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort, the President did not
respond directly and instead said he had ”great respect for what [Manafort]&#x2019;s done,
in terms of what he&#x2019;s gone through.” The President added that ”some of the
charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington
probably does.” In light of the President&#x2019;s counsel&#x2019;s previous statements that
the investigations ”might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons” and
that a pardon would be possible if the President ”come[s] to the conclusion that
you have been treated unfairly,” the evidence supports the inference that the
President intended Manafort to believe that he could receive a pardon, which would
make cooperation with the government as a means of obtaining a lesser sentence
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
unnecessary.
</p><!--l. 3829--><p class="indent" >   We also examined the evidence of the President&#x2019;s intent in making public statements
about Manafort at the beginning of his trial and when the jury was deliberating. Some
evidence supports a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence
the jury. The trial generated widespread publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate,
commentators suggested that an acquittal would add to pressure to end the Special
Counsel&#x2019;s investigation. By publicly stating on the second day of deliberations that
Manafort ”happens to be a very good person” and that ”it&#x2019;s very sad what they&#x2019;ve done to
Paul Manafort” right after calling the Special Counsel&#x2019;s investigation a ”rigged witch
hunt,” the President&#x2019;s statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural
tendency to engender sympathy for Manafort among jurors, and a fact finder
could infer that the President intended that result. But there are alternative
explanations for the President&#x2019;s comments, including that he genuinely felt sorry for
Manafort or that his goal was not to influence the jury but to influence public
opinion. The President&#x2019;s comments also could have been intended to continue
sending a message to Manafort that a pardon was possible. As described above,
the President made his comments about Manafort being ”a very good person”
immediately after declining to answer a question about whether he would pardon
Manafort.

<!--l. 3845--><p class="noindent" >The President&#x2019;s conduct involving Michael Cohen spans the full period of our investigation.
During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the
Trump Organization. Cohen briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times,
including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal. After the
media began questioning Trump&#x2019;s connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a ”party line”
that publicly distanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there. Cohen
continued to adhere to that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide
documents and testimony in its Russia investigation. In an attempt to minimize the
President&#x2019;s connections to Russia, Cohen submitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that
he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower Moscow project three times, that he did
not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen had not received a
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
response to an outreach he made to the Russian government, and that the project
ended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary. While
working on the congressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the
President&#x2019;s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should
not contradict the President and should keep the statement short and ”tight.”
After the FBI searched Cohen&#x2019;s home and office in April 2018, the President
publicly asserted that Cohen would not ”flip” and privately passed messages
of support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President&#x2019;s personal
counsel and believed that if he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the
President would do ”something else” to make the investigation end. But after
Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018, the President publicly
criticized him, called him a ”rat,” and suggested his family members had committed
crimes.

2015 until at least June 2016, the Trump Organization pursued a Trump Tower

 id="x1-78002f910"></a>
According to Cohen, in approximately September 2015 he obtained internal
approval from Trump to negotiate on behalf of the Trump Organization to have a
Russian corporation build a tower in Moscow that licensed the Trump name and
brand.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn911x0" id="fn911x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">911</sup></a></span><a

In December 2015, Felix Sater, who was handling negotiations between Cohen and the

facilitate travel to Russia to meet with government officials and possible financing
partners.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 3897--><p class="indent" >   By January 2016, Cohen had become frustrated that Sater had not set up a

approximately twenty minutes, during which Cohen described the Trump

they both understood would require false testimony. But Cohen said that he
and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen&#x2019;s testimony about
the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did
not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the
President about the specifics of his planned testimony. During the time when his
statement to Congress was being drafted and circulated to members of the JDA,
Cohen did not speak directly to the President about the statement, but rather
communicated with the President&#x2019;s personal counsel—as corroborated by phone
records showing extensive communications between Cohen and the President&#x2019;s
personal counsel before Cohen submitted his statement and when he testified before
Congress.

Trump than the statement reflected. Cohen recalled expressing some concern at that time.
According to Cohen, the President&#x2019;s personal counsel—who did not have first-hand
knowledge of the project—responded by saying that there was no need to muddy the water,
that it was unnecessary to include those details because the project did not take place, and
that Cohen should keep his statement short and tight, not elaborate, stay on
message, and not contradict the President. Cohen&#x2019;s recollection of the content of
those conversations is consistent with direction about the substance of Cohen&#x2019;s
draft statement that appeared to come from members of the JDA. For example,
Cohen omitted any reference to his outreach to Russian government officials to
set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the United Nations General
Assembly, and Cohen believed it was a decision of the JDA to delete the sentence,
”The building project led me to make limited contacts with Russian government
officials.”
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 4495--><p class="indent" >   The President&#x2019;s personal counsel declined to provide us with his account of his
conversations with Cohen, and there is no evidence available to us that indicates that the
President was aware of the information Cohen provided to the President&#x2019;s personal counsel.
The President&#x2019;s conversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by
attorney–client privilege, and we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such
communications. The absence of evidence about the President and his counsel&#x2019;s
conversations about the drafting of Cohen&#x2019;s statement precludes us from assessing what, if
any, role the President played.
</p><!--l. 4499--><p class="indent" >   Second, we considered whether the President took actions that would have the natural
tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to criminal investigators or
to Congress.
</p><!--l. 4501--><p class="indent" >   Before Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly
and privately urged Cohen to stay on message and not ”flip.” Cohen recalled
the President&#x2019;s personal counsel telling him that he would be protected so long
as he did not go ”rogue.” In the days and weeks that followed the April 2018
searches of Cohen&#x2019;s home and office, the President told reporters that Cohen was a
”good man” and said he was” a fine person with a wonderful family … who I
have always liked &#x0026; respected.” Privately, the President told Cohen to ”hang in
there” and ”stay strong.” People who were close to both Cohen and the President
passed messages to Cohen that ”the President loves you,””the boss loves you,”
and ”everyone knows the boss has your back.” Through the President&#x2019;s personal
counsel, the President also had previously told Cohen ”thanks for what you do”
after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to women that,
according to Cohen, both Cohen and the President knew was false. At that time, the
Trump Organization continued to pay Cohen&#x2019;s legal fees, which was important
to Cohen. Cohen also recalled discussing the possibility of a pardon with the
President&#x2019;s personal counsel, who told him to stay on message and everything
would be fine. The President indicated in his public statements that a pardon had
not been ruled out, and also stated publicly that ”[m]ost people will flip if the
Government lets them out of trouble” but that he ”d[idn&#x2019;t] see Michael doing
that.”
</p><!--l. 4509--><p class="indent" >   After it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government, however,
the President accused Cohen of ”mak[ing] up stories in order to get himself out of an
unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?),” called Cohen a ”rat,” and on multiple occasions
publicly suggested that Cohen&#x2019;s family members had committed crimes. The
evidence concerning this sequence of events could support an inference that the
President used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get
Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the
provision of information or undermine Cohen&#x2019;s credibility once Cohen began
cooperating.
</p><!--l. 4512--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Nexus to an official proceeding.</span> The President&#x2019;s relevant conduct towards Cohen
occurred when the President knew the Special Counsel&#x2019;s Office, Congress, and the U.S.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Attorney&#x2019;s Office for the Southern District of New York were investigating Cohen&#x2019;s
conduct. The President acknowledged through his public statements and tweets that Cohen
potentially could cooperate with the government investigations.
</p><!--l. 4516--><p class="indent" >   <span class="underline">Intent.</span> In analyzing the President&#x2019;s intent in his actions towards Cohen as a potential
witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended
to discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen&#x2019;s
information would shed adverse light on the President&#x2019;s campaign-period conduct and
statements.
</p><!--l. 4519--><p class="indent" >   Cohen&#x2019;s false congressional testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project was
designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit the
congressional and DOJ Russia investigations—a goal that was in the President&#x2019;s interest,
as reflected by the President&#x2019;s own statements. During and after the campaign, the
President made repeated statements that he had ”no business” in Russia and said that
there were ”no deals that could happen in Russia, because we&#x2019;ve stayed away.” As Cohen
knew, and as he recalled communicating to the President during the campaign, Cohen&#x2019;s
pursuit of the Trump Tower Moscow project cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness of
these statements.
</p><!--l. 4523--><p class="indent" >   In connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations
with candidate Trump to give him status updates about the Trump Tower Moscow
project, that the conversations continued through at least June 2016, and that
he discussed with Trump possible travel to Russia to pursue the project. The
conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen, because the project had the
potential to be so lucrative. In addition, text messages to and from Cohen and other
records further establish that Cohen&#x2019;s efforts to advance the project did not end
in January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen was considering the
timing for possible trips to Russia by him and Trump in connection with the
project.
</p><!--l. 4527--><p class="indent" >   The evidence could support an inference that the President was aware of these facts at
the time of Cohen&#x2019;s false statements to Congress. Cohen discussed the project with the
President in early 2017 following media inquiries. Cohen recalled that on September 20,
2017, the day after he released to the public his opening remarks to Congress—which said
the project ”was terminated in January of 2016”—the President&#x2019;s personal counsel told
him the President was pleased with what Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow.
And after Cohen&#x2019;s guilty plea, the President told reporters that he had ultimately decided
not to do the project, which supports the inference that he remained aware of his own
involvement in the project and the period during the Campaign in which the project was&#x2019;
being pursued.
</p><!--l. 4532--><p class="indent" >   The President&#x2019;s public remarks following Cohen&#x2019;s guilty plea also suggest that the
President may have been concerned about what Cohen told investigators about the Trump
Tower Moscow project. At the time the President submitted written answers to
questions from this Office about the project and other subjects, the media had
reported that Cohen was cooperating with the government but Cohen had not yet
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress. Accordingly, it was not
publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided to the
government. In his written answers, the President did not provide details about
the timing and substance of his discussions with Cohen about the project and
gave no indication that he had decided to no longer pursue the project. Yet after
Cohen pleaded guilty, the President publicly stated that he had personally made
the decision to abandon the project. The President then declined to clarify the
seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions. The content
and timing of the President&#x2019;s provision of information about his knowledge and
actions regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President
may have been concerned about the information that Cohen could provide as a
witness.
</p><!--l. 4540--><p class="indent" >   The President&#x2019;s concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed at the
Southern District of New York investigation into other aspects of the President&#x2019;s dealings
with Cohen rather than an investigation of Trump Tower Moscow. There also is some
evidence that the President&#x2019;s concern about Cohen cooperating was based on the
President&#x2019;s stated belief that Cohen would provide false testimony against the President in
an attempt to obtain a lesser sentence for his unrelated criminal conduct. The President
tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen, refused to ”break” and ”make up stories in order to
get a &#x2019;deal.&#x2019;” And after Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress, the
President said, ”what [Cohen]&#x2019;s trying to do is get a reduced sentence. So he&#x2019;s lying about
a project that everybody knew about.” But the President also appeared to defend
the underlying conduct, saying, ”Even if [Cohen] was right, it doesn&#x2019;t matter
because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign.” As described
above, there is evidence that the President knew that Cohen had made false
statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project and that Cohen did so to protect
the President and minimize the President&#x2019;s connections to Russia during the
campaign.
</p><!--l. 4547--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the President&#x2019;s statements insinuating that members of Cohen&#x2019;s family
committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the government could be viewed
as an effort to retaliate against Cohen and chill further testimony adverse to
the President by Cohen or others. It is possible that the President believes, as
reflected in his tweets, that Cohen ”ma[d]e[] up stories” in order to get a deal for
himself and ”get his wife and father-in-law … off Scott Free.” It also is possible
that the President&#x2019;s mention of Cohen&#x2019;s wife and father-in-law were not intended
to affect Cohen as a witness but rather were part of a public-relations strategy
aimed at discrediting Cohen and deflecting attention away from the President on
Cohen-related matters. But the President&#x2019;s suggestion that Cohen&#x2019;s family members
committed crimes happened more than once, including just before Cohen was
sentenced (at the same time as the President stated that Cohen ”should, in my
opinion, serve a full and complete sentence”) and again just before Cohen was
scheduled to testify before Congress. The timing of the statements supports an
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
inference that they were intended at least in part to discourage Cohen from further
cooperation.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">L.   </span> <a 
 id="x1-83000L."></a>Overarching Factual Issues</h4>
<!--l. 4554--><p class="noindent" >Although this report does not contain a traditional prosecution decision or declination
decision, the evidence supports several general conclusions relevant to analysis of the facts
concerning the President&#x2019;s course of conduct.
</p><!--l. 4556--><p class="indent" >   Three features of this case render it atypical compared to the heartland
obstruction-of-justice prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice.
</p><!--l. 4558--><p class="indent" >   First, the conduct involved actions by the President. Some of the conduct did
not implicate the President&#x2019;s constitutional authority and raises garden-variety
obstruction-of-justice issues. Other events we investigated, however, drew upon
the President&#x2019;s Article II authority, which raised constitutional issues that we
address in Volume II, Section III.B, <span 
class="cmti-12">infra</span>. A factual analysis of that conduct would
have to take into account both that the President&#x2019;s acts were facially lawful and
that his position as head of the Executive Branch provides him with unique and
powerful means of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential
witnesses.
</p><!--l. 4563--><p class="indent" >   Second, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up
of an underlying crime. Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence
that the individual had an improper obstructive purpose, see, e.g., United States
v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 24 (2d Cir. 1988), or that he contemplated an effect
on an official proceeding, see, e.g., United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 591
(2d Cir. 2015). But proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction
offense. See United States v. Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir. 2017) (stating, in
applying the obstruction sentencing guideline, that ”obstruction of a criminal
investigation is punishable even if the prosecution is ultimately unsuccessful or
even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying crime”). Obstruction of
justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal interests,
to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a
gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the
justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying
wrong.
</p><!--l. 4570--><p class="indent" >   In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was
involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the
evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the
President&#x2019;s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would
call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about
whether certain events—such as advance notice of WikiLeaks&#x2019;s release of hacked
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and
Russians—could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his
family.
</p><!--l. 4574--><p class="indent" >   Third, many of the President&#x2019;s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of
cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in
public view. While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were
motivated by a corrupt intent, the President&#x2019;s power to influence actions, persons, and
events is enhanced by his unique ability to attract attention through use of mass
communications. And no principle of law excludes public acts from the scope of obstruction
statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to intimidate witnesses or alter their testimony,
the justice system&#x2019;s integrity is equally threatened.
</p><!--l. 4579--><p class="indent" >   Although the events we investigated involved discrete acts—e.g., the President&#x2019;s
statement to Comey about the Flynn investigation, his termination of Comey, and his
efforts to remove the Special Counsel—it is important to view the President&#x2019;s pattern of
conduct as a whole. That pattern sheds light on the nature of the President&#x2019;s acts and the
inferences that can be drawn about his intent.
</p><!--l. 4582--><p class="indent" >   Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting
undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and
obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one
meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels.
These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of
the Attorney General&#x2019;s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the
scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the
potential to influence their testimony. Viewing the acts collectively can help to
illuminate their significance. For example, the President&#x2019;s direction to McGahn to have
the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediately by his direction
to Lewandowski to tell the Attorney General to limit the scope of the Russia
investigation to prospective election—interference only—a temporal connection that
suggests that both acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the
investigation.
</p><!--l. 4588--><p class="indent" >   The President&#x2019;s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that
is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or
accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately
resulted in Flynn&#x2019;s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell
the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead
prepared to resign over the President&#x2019;s order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not
deliver the President&#x2019;s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia
investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from
his recollections about events surrounding the President&#x2019;s direction to have the
Special Counsel removed, despite the President&#x2019;s multiple demands that he do so.
Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential
obstruction charges against the President&#x2019;s aides and associates beyond those already
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
filed.
</p><!--l. 4595--><p class="indent" >   In considering the full scope of the conduct we investigated, the President&#x2019;s actions can
be divided into two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President&#x2019;s motives. In
the first phase, before the President fired Comey, the President had been assured that the
FBI had not opened an investigation of him personally. The President deemed it critically
important to make public that he was not under investigation, and he included that
information in his termination letter to Comey after other efforts to have that information
disclosed were unsuccessful.
</p><!--l. 4599--><p class="indent" >   Soon after he fired Comey, however, the President became aware that investigators were
conducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into his own conduct. That awareness marked
a significant change in the President&#x2019;s conduct and the start of a second phase of action.
The President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved
in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the
President engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation. For
instance, the President attempted to remove the Special Counsel; he sought to
have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the investigation; he
sought to prevent public disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 meeting
between Russians and campaign officials; and he used public forums to attack
potential witnesses who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who
declined to cooperate with the government. Judgments about the nature of the
President&#x2019;s motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the
evidence.

 id="x1-84000III."></a>Legal Defenses to the Application of Obstruction-of-Justice Statutes to the
President</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The President&#x2019;s personal counsel has written to this Office to advance statutory and constitutional
defenses to the potential application of the obstruction-of-justice statutes to the President&#x2019;s
conduct.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1072x0" id="fn1072x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1072</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-84001f1072"></a>
As a statutory matter, the President&#x2019;s counsel has argued that a core
obstruction-of-justice statute, 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 1512(c)(2), does not cover the President&#x2019;s
actions.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1073x0" id="fn1073x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1073</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-84002f1073"></a>
As a constitutional matter, the President&#x2019;s counsel argued that the
President cannot obstruct justice by exercising his constitutional authority
to close Department of Justice investigations or terminate the FBI
Director.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1074x0" id="fn1074x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1074</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-84003f1074"></a>
Under that view, any statute that restricts the President&#x2019;s exercise of those powers would
impermissibly intrude on the President&#x2019;s constitutional role. The President&#x2019;s counsel has
conceded that the President may be subject to criminal laws that do not directly involve
exercises of his Article II authority, such as laws prohibiting bribing witnesses or suborning
perjury.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1075x0" id="fn1075x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1075</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-84004f1075"></a>
But counsel has made a categorical argument that “the President&#x2019;s exercise
of his constitutional authority here to terminate an FBI Director and
to close investigations cannot constitutionally constitute obstruction of
justice.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1076x0" id="fn1076x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1076</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-84005f1076"></a>
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   In analyzing counsel&#x2019;s statutory arguments, we concluded that the President&#x2019;s
proposed interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2) is contrary to the litigating position
of the Department of Justice and is not supported by principles of statutory
construction.
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   As for the constitutional arguments, we recognized that the Department of Justice and
the courts have not definitively resolved these constitutional issues. We therefore analyzed
the President&#x2019;s position through the framework of Supreme Court precedent addressing
the separation of powers. Under that framework, we concluded, Article II of the
Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize the President
from potential liability for the conduct that we investigated. Rather, our analysis
led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can validly prohibit a
President&#x2019;s corrupt efforts to use his official powers to curtail, end, or interfere with an
investigation.

While defendants have argued that subsection (c)(2) should be read to cover only acts that

1512(c)(2) confirms that its sweep is not tethered to Section 1512(c)(1); courts have so
interpreted it; its history does not counsel otherwise; and no principle of statutory
construction dictates a contrary view. On its face, therefore, Section 1512(c)(2) applies to
all corrupt means of obstructing a proceeding, pending or contemplated—including by
improper exercises of official power. In addition, other statutory provisions that are
potentially applicable to certain conduct we investigated broadly prohibit obstruction of
proceedings that are pending before courts, grand juries, and Congress. <span

Acts</h5>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Several textual features of Section 1512(c)(2) support the conclusion that the
provision broadly prohibits corrupt means of obstructing justice and is not limited by
the more specific prohibitions in Section 1512(c)(1), which focus on evidence
impairment.
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   First, the text of Section 1512(c)(2) is unqualified: it reaches acts that “obstruct[],
influence[], or impede[] any official proceeding” when committed “corruptly.” Nothing in
Section 1512(c)(2)&#x2019;s text limits the provision to acts that would impair the integrity or
availability of evidence for use in an official proceeding. In contrast, Section 1512(c)(1)
explicitly includes the requirement that the defendant act “with the intent to impair the
object&#x2019;s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding,” a requirement
that Congress also included in two other sections of Section 1512. <span 
class="cmti-12">See </span>18 U.S.C.
<span

persuasion, or misleading conduct with intent to cause a person to destroy an object
“with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use in an
official proceeding”). But no comparable intent or conduct element focused on
evidence impairment appears in Section 1512(c)(2). The intent element in Section
1512(c)(2) comes from the word “corruptly.” <span 
class="cmti-12">See, e.g., United States v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> McKibbins</span>,
656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th Cir. 2011) (“The intent element is important because
the word ‘corruptly&#x2019; is what serves to separate criminal and innocent acts of
obstruction.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the conduct element in Section
1512(c)(2) is “obstruct[ing], influenc[ing], or imped[ing]” a proceeding. Congress is
presumed to have acted intentionally in the disparate inclusion and exclusion of
evidence-impairment language. <span

</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   Second, the structure of Section 1512 supports the conclusion that Section
1512(c)(2) defines an independent offense. Section 1512(c)(2) delineates a complete
crime with different elements from Section 1512(c)(1) – and each subsection of
Section 1512(c) contains its own “attempt” prohibition, underscoring that they are
independent prohibitions. The two subsections of Section 1512(c) are connected by the
conjunction “or,” indicating that each provides an alternative basis for criminal
liability. <span 
class="cmti-12">See Loughrin</span>, 573 U.S. at 357 (“ordinary use [of ‘or&#x2019;] is almost always
disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given separate meanings”) (internal

class="cmti-12">Loughrin</span>, for example, the Supreme Court relied
on the use of the word “or” to hold that adjacent and overlapping subsections
of the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span> 1344, state distinct offenses and that
subsection 1344(2) therefore should not be interpreted to contain an additional

provision covers obstructive acts that are different from those listed in Section 1512(c)(1).

provision covers obstructive acts <span

</p><!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   Section 1512(c)(2)&#x2019;s breadth is reinforced by the similarity of its language to the
omnibus clause of 18 U.S.C. <span

impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.”
That clause of Section 1503 follows two more specific clauses that protect jurors,
judges, and court officers. The omnibus clause has nevertheless been construed to
be “far more general in scope than the earlier clauses of the statute.” <span

<span 
class="cmti-12">States v.</span><span

(collecting cases). Given the similarity of Section 1512(c)(2) to Section 1503&#x2019;s
omnibus clause, Congress would have expected Section 1512(c)(2) to cover acts
that produced a similar result to the evidence-impairment provisions—i.e., the
result of obstructing justice—rather than covering only acts that were similar in
manner. Read this way, Section 1512(c)(2) serves a distinct function in the federal
obstruction-of-justice statutes: it captures corrupt conduct, other than document
destruction, that has the natural tendency to obstruct contemplated as well as pending
proceedings.

proceedings, reach “endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede” the proceedings—a
broader test for inchoate violations than Section 1512(c)(2)&#x2019;s “attempt” standard, which

construction. <span 
class="cmti-12">Cleveland v.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> United States</span>, 531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000). “[A]s [the Court

uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must simply guess as to what
Congress intended.” <span

class="cmti-12"> United States</span>, 573 U.S. 169, 188 n.10 (2014)
(internal quotation marks omitted). The rule has been cited, for example, in
adopting a narrow meaning of “tangible object” in an obstruction statute when the
prohibition&#x2019;s title, history, and list of prohibited acts indicated a focus on destruction of
records. <span

Here, as discussed above, the text, structure, and history of Section 1512(c)(2)

provision like Section 1512(c)(2) to exclude corruptly motivated obstructive acts only when
carried out in the President&#x2019;s conduct of office. No statutory term could easily bear that
specialized meaning. For example, the word “corruptly” has a well-established
meaning that does not exclude exercises of official power for corrupt ends. Indeed,

statutes to presidential actions affects the President&#x2019;s ability to carry out his
Article II responsibilities. <span 
class="cmti-12">Administrator of General Services</span>, 433 U.S. at 443. As
discussed above, applying obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential conduct
that does not involve the President&#x2019;s conduct of office—such as influencing the
testimony of witnesses—is constitutionally unproblematic. The President has no more
right than other citizens to impede official proceedings by corruptly influencing
witness testimony. The conduct would be equally improper whether effectuated
through direct efforts to produce false testimony or suppress the truth, or through
the actual, threatened, or promised use of official powers to achieve the same
result.
</p><!--l. 414--><p class="indent" >   The President&#x2019;s action in curtailing criminal investigations or prosecutions, or
discharging law enforcement officials, raises different questions. Each type of action involves

that the Laws be faithfully executed.” <span

constitutionally impermissible.”). Yet the obstruction-of-justice statutes do not
aggrandize power in Congress or usurp executive authority. Instead, they impose a
discrete limitation on conduct only when it is taken with the “corrupt” intent to
obstruct justice. The obstruction statutes thus would restrict presidential action only
by prohibiting the President from acting to obstruct official proceedings for the
improper purpose of protecting his own interests. See Volume II, Section III.A.3,
<span

</p><!--l. 424--><p class="indent" >   The direct effect on the President&#x2019;s freedom of action would correspondingly be a
limited one. A preclusion of “corrupt” official action is not a major intrusion on Article II
powers. For example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for
the President to act with the intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment,
avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a

</p><!--l. 464--><p class="indent" >   Where the Constitution permits Congress to impose a good-cause limitation
on the removal of an Executive Branch officer, the Constitution should equally
permit Congress to bar removal for the corrupt purpose of obstructing justice.
Limiting the range of permissible reasons for removal to exclude a “corrupt”
purpose imposes a lesser restraint on the President than requiring an affirmative
showing of good cause. It follows that for such inferior officers, Congress may
constitutionally restrict the President&#x2019;s removal authority if that authority was
exercised for the corrupt purpose of obstructing justice. And even if a particular
inferior officer&#x2019;s position might be of such importance to the execution of the laws
that the President must have at-will removal authority, the obstruction-of-justice
statutes could still be constitutionally applied to forbid removal for a corrupt
reason.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

A narrow and discrete limitation on removal that precluded corrupt action would leave
ample room for all other considerations, including disagreement over policy or loss of
confidence in the officer&#x2019;s judgment or commitment. A corrupt-purpose prohibition
therefore would not undermine the President&#x2019;s ability to perform his Article II functions.
Accordingly, because the separation-of-powers question is “whether the removal restrictions
are of such a nature that they impede the President&#x2019;s ability to perform his constitutional
duty,” <span 
class="cmti-12">Morrison</span>, 487 U.S. at 691, a restriction on removing an inferior officer for
a corrupt reason—a reason grounded in achieving personal rather than official

President retains broad latitude to supervise investigations and remove officials,
circumscribed in this context only by the requirement that he not act for corrupt personal

an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of
Congress.” <span

determining as a factual matter whether he engaged in an obstructive act, whether the act
had a nexus to official proceedings, and whether he was motivated by corrupt intent. But
applying those standards to the President&#x2019;s official conduct should not hinder
his ability to perform his Article II duties. <span 
class="cmti-12">Cf.</span><span 
class="cmti-12"> Nixon v.</span><span

at 752–753 &#x0026; n.32 (taking into account chilling effect on the President in adopting a
constitutional rule of presidential immunity from private civil damages action

existence of settled legal standards, the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial
actions, and the existence of evidentiary limitations on probing the President&#x2019;s
motives. And historical experience confirms that no impermissible chill should
exist.
</p><!--l. 542--><p class="indent" >   a. As an initial matter, the term “corruptly” sets a demanding standard. It requires a
concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an “improper advantage
for [him]self or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of
others.” BALLENTINE&#x2019;S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed. 1969); <span 
class="cmti-12">see United States</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">v.</span><span

class="cmti-12">Aguilar</span>, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part). That standard parallels the President&#x2019;s
constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws. And virtually
everything that the President does in the routine conduct of office will have a clear
governmental purpose and will not be contrary to his official duty. Accordingly,
the President has no reason to be chilled in those actions because, in virtually
all instances, there will be no credible basis for suspecting a corrupt personal
motive.
</p><!--l. 550--><p class="indent" >   That point is illustrated by examples of conduct that would and would not satisfy the
stringent corrupt-motive standard. Direct or indirect action by the President to end a
criminal investigation into his own or his family members&#x2019; conduct to protect against
personal embarrassment or legal liability would constitute a core example of corruptly
motivated conduct. So too would action to halt an enforcement proceeding that directly
and adversely affected the President&#x2019;s financial interests for the purpose of protecting those
interests. In those examples, official power is being used for the purpose of protecting the
President&#x2019;s personal interests. In contrast, the President&#x2019;s actions to serve political or
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
policy interests would not qualify as corrupt. The President&#x2019;s role as head of
the government necessarily requires him to take into account political factors in
making policy decisions that affect law-enforcement actions and proceedings. For
instance, the President&#x2019;s decision to curtail a law-enforcement investigation to avoid
international friction would not implicate the obstruction-of-justice statutes. The
criminal law does not seek to regulate the consideration of such political or policy
factors in the conduct of government. And when legitimate interests animate the
President&#x2019;s conduct, those interests will almost invariably be readily identifiable
based on objective factors. Because the President&#x2019;s conduct in those instances will
obviously fall outside the zone of obstruction law, no chilling concern should
arise.
</p><!--l. 561--><p class="indent" >   b. There is also no reason to believe that investigations, let alone prosecutions, would
occur except in highly unusual circumstances when a credible factual basis exists to believe
that obstruction occurred. Prosecutorial action enjoys a presumption of regularity: absent

regularity would provide even greater protection to the President than exists
in routine cases given the prominence and sensitivity of any matter involving
the President and the likelihood that such matters will be subject to thorough
and careful review at the most senior levels of the Department of Justice. Under
OLC&#x2019;s opinion that a sitting President is entitled to immunity from indictment,
only a successor Administration would be able to prosecute a former President.
But that consideration does not suggest that a President would have any basis
for fearing abusive investigations or prosecutions after leaving office. There are
“obvious political checks” against initiating a baseless investigation or prosecution
of a former President. <span

President&#x2019;s motivations would turn on any explanation he provided to justify his actions,
the advice he received, the circumstances surrounding the actions, and the regularity or
irregularity of the process he employed to make decisions. But grand juries and courts
would not have automatic access to confidential presidential communications on
those matters; rather, they could be presented in official proceedings only on a
showing of sufficient need. <span

effect justifies exempting the President from the obstruction laws. As a historical
matter, Presidents have very seldom been the subjects of grand jury investigations.
And it is rarer still for circumstances to raise even the possibility of a corrupt
personal motive for arguably obstructive action through the President&#x2019;s use of official
power. Accordingly, the President&#x2019;s conduct of office should not be chilled based on
hypothetical concerns about the possible application of a corrupt-motive standard in this
context.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw
ultimate conclusions about the President&#x2019;s conduct. The evidence we obtained about the
President&#x2019;s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we
were making traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence
after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit
obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal
standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does
not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate
him.

<span

<span 
class="cmr-10">had communicated to the President&#x2019;s personal counsel, and not what was said in response. Cohen described</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10">certain statements made by the President&#x2019;s personal counsel, however, that are set forth in this</span>
<span

<span 
class="cmr-10">conversations with Cohen related to Cohen&#x2019;s congressional testimony about Trump Tower</span>

<span

<span
