[Open Source Mueller Report](http://opensourcemuellerreport.com) is an effort to correct the technical limitations of the PDF released by the DOJ on April 18, 2019. We are producing PDF and ePub files that work much better than the original PDF. (We have rewritten it from scratch in LaTeX.)

We have drafts for Volume 1 and the Appendix - and Volume 2 is nearly complete, as well.
