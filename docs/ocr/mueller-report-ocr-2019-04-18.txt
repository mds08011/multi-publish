INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME I This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuantto 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which states that, "[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special Counsel] reached." The Russian governmentinterfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016. In June, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team publicly announced that Russian hackers had compromised its computer network. Releases of hacked materials--hacks that public reporting soon attributed to the Russian government--began that same month. Additionalreleases followed in July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in October and November. In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks's first release of stolen documents, a foreign governmentcontacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaignforeign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign governmentthat the Trump Campaignhadreceived indications from the Russian governmentthat it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to openaninvestigation into whetherindividuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the Russian governmentin its interference activities. That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government "directed recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political organizations," and, "[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the USelection process." After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election. By early 2017, several congressional committees were examining Russia's interference in the election. Within the Executive Branch,these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017 appointmentof Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the Special Counsel authorized him to investigate "the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election," including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Asset forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel's investigation established that Russiainterfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russianintelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also identified numerous links between the Russian governmentand the Trump Campaign. Although the investigation established that the Russian governmentperceivedit would benefit from a Trump presidency and workedto secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit

U.S. Department of Justice Attorney-WorkPreduet // Protected
electorally from information stolen and released through Russianefforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian governmentin its election interference activities.
* OK OK
Below wedescribe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements about the results of our investigation and the Special Counsel's charging decisions, and we then provide an overview of the two volumesofourreport.
The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel's Office found to be supported by the evidencecollected in our investigation. In someinstances, the report points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there wasno evidence ofthose facts.
In evaluating whether evidence aboutcollective action of multiple individuals constituted acrime, weapplied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of "collusion." In so doing, the Office recognized that the word "collud[e]" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invokedin public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory ofliability found in the United States Code, noris it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons,the Office's focusin analyzing questionsofjoint criminalliability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign "coordinat[ed]"--a term that appears in the appointment order--with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, "coordination" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement--tacit or express--between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informedbyorresponsive to the other's actionsor interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense whenstating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian governmentin its election interference activities.

The report on our investigation consists of two volumes: Volume I describes the factual results of the Special Counsel's investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and its interactions with the Trump Campaign. Section I describes the scopeof the investigation. SectionsII andIII describe the principal ways Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Section IV describes links between the Russian

governmentandindividuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Section V sets forth the Special Counsel's charging decisions.
Volume II addresses the President's actions towards the FBI's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters, and his actions towards the Special Counsel's investigation. VolumeII separately states its framework and the considerations that guided that investigation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME I RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference operations identified by the investigation--a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and received funding from Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he controlled. Prigozhin is widely reported to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Harm to Ongoing Matter
In mid-2014, the IRA sent employees to the United States on an intelligence-gathering Micsmencrccena arm to Ongoing Matter
The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. political system through what it termed "information warfare." The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton. The IRA's operation also included the purchaseofpolitical advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. personsand entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize thoserallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Office's investigation of the Russian social media campaign.
RUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS Atthe sametime that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service knownas the MainIntelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRUstole hundreds of thousands of documentsfrom the compromised email accounts and networks. Aroundthe time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas "DCLeaks" and "Guccifer 2.0." The GRUlater released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.

WikiLeaks began releasing Podesta's stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released video considered damaging to candidate Trump. Section III of this Report details the Office's investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts by Trump Campaign supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails.

RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN

The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities. Although the investigation established that the Russian governmentperceived it would benefit from a Trumppresidency and. worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expectedit would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russianefforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian governmentin its election interference activities.

The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person,invitations for Campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved U.S.-Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia and the Trump Campaign during the campaign andtransition periods, the most salient of which are summarized below in chronologicalorder.

2015. Someof the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump Organization real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate Trumpsigned a Letter ofIntent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization executive Michael Cohen emailed and spoke about the project with the office of Russian governmentpress secretary Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through at least June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Trump.

Spring 2016. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos madeearly contact with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told Papadopoulosthat the Russian government had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands

U.S. Departmentof Justice Axttorney-Work // Proteeted
of emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign governmentthat the Trump Campaign had receivedindications from the Russian governmentthat it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damagingto candidate Clinton. Throughoutthat period oftime and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting tookplace.
Summer 2016. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer of 2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nomineefor President. On June 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaignofficials Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what the email proposing the meeting had described as "official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary." The materials were offered to Trump Jr. as "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump." The written communications setting up the meeting showed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist candidate Trump's electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer's presentation did not provide such information.
Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and the DNC announced that Russian government hackers had infiltrated the DNC and obtained access to opposition research on candidate Trump, among other documents.
In July 2016, Campaignforeign policy advisor Carter Pagetraveled in his personal capacity to Moscow and gavethe keynote address at the New Economic School. Page had lived and worked in Russia between 2003 and 2007. After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted with at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was later charged in 2015 with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia. Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow andhis advocacyfor pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention. The Campaignthen distanceditself from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign.
July 2016 wasalso the month WikiLeaksfirst released emails stolen by the GRU from the DNC. OnJuly 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents revealing information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S. intelligence agencies had "high confidence" that the Russian government was behind thetheft of emails and documents from the DNC. And within a weekof the release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign governmentreporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the Russian governmentand individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.
Separately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBIassesses to haveties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnil requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel's Office was a "backdoor" way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate Trump's assent to succeed (were heto be elected President). They also discussed the status of the

U.S. Departmentof Justice Work // PrMay-Centi oMaterilteet Fed Re -Crim P-6d fe)}
Trump Campaign and Manafort's strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states. Monthsbefore that meeting, Manafort had causedinternal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for someperiodoftime after their August meeting.
Fall 2016. On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking in graphic terms about womenyears earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy. Less than an hourlater, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of John Podesta's emails that had been stolen by the GRUin late March 2016. The FBI and other U.S. governmentinstitutions wereat the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian governmentefforts to interfere in the presidential election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director ofNationalIntelligence issued a joint public statement "that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations." Those "thefts" and the "disclosures" of the hacked materials through online platforms such as WikiLeaks, the statement continued, "are intended to interfere with the US election process."
Post-2016 Election. Immediately after the November 8 election, Russian government officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new administration. The most seniorlevels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The Russian Embassy made contacthours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to arrange a call with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen picked upthe effort from there.
Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, was among the Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early December, a business associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump Campaign and an associate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face in January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.-Russia relations. During the same period, another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend of Jared Kushner who had not served on the Campaignor the Transition Team. Dmitriev and Kushner's friend collaborated on a short written reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been cleared through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration, and Kushnerlater gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
On December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election. Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response to the sanctions. The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctionsat that time. Hours later, President-Elect Trump tweeted, "Great move on delay (by V. Putin)." The next day, on December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn andtold him the request had beenreceived at the highest levels and Russia had chosen notto retaliate as a result of Flynn's request.

OnJanuary 6, 2017, membersoftheintelligence community briefed President-Elect Trump on a joint assessment--drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, and

U.S. DepartmentofJustice Attorney--WorkPreduet // PrMay-Conti oteeUnder t Fed R-e Crim Pd -
National Security Agency--that concluded with high confidence that Russia hadintervenedin the election through a variety of means to assist Trump's candidacy and harm Clinton's. A declassified version of the assessment waspublicly released that same day.
Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees--the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)--announced that they would conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the election. Then-FBI Director James Comeylater confirmed to Congressthe existence of the FBI's investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election. On March 20, 2017,in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Comeystated:
I have been authorized by the Departmentof Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission,is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts. ... As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. Theinvestigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks until May 9, 2017, when President Trump fired Comey as FBI Director--an action which is analyzed in VolumeII of the report. On May17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his congressional testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a), which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the investigation. President Trumpreacted negatively to the Special Counsel's appointment. He told advisors that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions unrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in efforts to curtail the Special Counsel's investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidencetoit, including through public and private contacts with potential witnesses. Those andrelated actions are described and analyzed in VolumeII of the report.

THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S CHARGING DECISIONS In reaching the charging decisions described in Volume I of the report, the Office determined whether the conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law chargeable under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual § 9-27.000 et seq. (2018). The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime; if so, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction;

U.S. Department of Justice Attorney-WorkPreduet // Proteeted-Under
and whether prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest that could not be adequately served by prosecution elsewhere or through non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual § 927.220.
Section V of the report providesdetailed explanationsof the Office's charging decisions, which contain three main components.
First, the Office determined that Russia's twoprincipal interference operationsin the 2016 U.S. presidential election--the social media campaign andthe hacking-and-dumping operations-- violated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media campaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by undermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influencein U.S. elections, as well as related counts of identity theft. See United States v. Internet Research Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers who carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate, among other federal laws,
the fsehdoer,aletcaolm.,puNtoe.r-1i8n-tcrru-s2i1o5n s(tDa.tDu.tCe,.).anRd tEheyTRhaOveeTbeTeinresoEcTharCged. See United States v.

Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Amongother things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agentof the Russian governmentor other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks's releases of hacked materials wasnotsufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian governmentto interfere in the 2016 election.

Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump

Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated

individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian

election interference. The Office charged some ofthose lies as violations of the federal false-

statements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about

his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the transition period. George

Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to

investigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the

professor who told Papadopoulosthat the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton in the form of

thousands of emails. Former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to

making false statements to Congress about the Trump

Andin February 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that

U.S. Department of Justice Atterney-WorkPreduet // PreMay-Conti teMaterileted-UFed nR-Cd rittePB, r
Manafort lied to the Office and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for Ukraine.
KOK
The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve potential Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that interactions between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaignofficials both at the candidate's April 2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week ofthe Republican National Convention werebrief, public, and non-substantive. And the investigation did not establish that one Campaign official's efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions's Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.
The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendmentright against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information--suchas information knowntoattorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media--in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice Manual§§ 9-13.400, 13.410. Someofthe information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or "taint") team. Even whenindividuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to someofthe false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as well--numerouswitnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United States.
Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we investigated--including some associated with the Trump Campaign--deleted relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other knownfacts.
Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinationsthat the Office believes to be accurate and completeto the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps, the Office cannotrule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.

I. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein--then serving as Acting
Attorney General for the Russia investigation following the recusal of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 2, 2016--appointed the Special Counsel "to investigate Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters." Office of the Deputy Att'y Gen., Order No. 3915-2017, Appointment ofSpecial Counselto Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters, May 17, 2017) ("Appointment Order"), Relying on "the authority vested" in the Acting Attorney General, "including 28 U.S.C. §§ 509, 510, and 515," the Acting Attorney General ordered the appointment of a Special Counsel "in order to discharge [the Acting Attorney General's] responsibility to provide supervision and managementof the Departmentof Justice, and to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election." Appointment Order (introduction). "The Special Counsel,"the Orderstated,"is authorized to conductthe investigation confirmed by then-FBIDirector James B, Comeyin testimony before the House PermanentSelect Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017," including:
(i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian governmentand individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and
(ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and (iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). Appointment Order { (b). Section 600.4 affords the Special Counsel "the authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses." 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). The authority to investigate "any matters that arose . . . directly from the investigation," Appointment Order { (b)(ii), covers similar crimes that may have occurred during the course of the FBI's confirmed investigation before the Special Counsel's appointment. "If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate," the Order further provided,"the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation ofthese matters." Id. J (c). Finally, the Acting Attorney General made applicable "Sections 600.4 through 600.10 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations." Jd. J (d). The Acting Attorney General further clarified the scope of the Special Counsel's investigatory authority in two subsequent memoranda. A memorandum dated August 2, 2017, explained that the Appointment Order had been "worded categorically in order to permit its public release without confirming specific investigations involving specific individuals." It then confirmed that the Special Counsel had been authorized since his appointment to investigate allegations that three Trump campaign officials--Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and George Papadopoulos--`committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian governmentofficials with respect to the Russian government's efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election." The memorandum also confirmed the Special Counsel's authority to investigate certain other matters, including two additional sets of allegations involving Manafort (crimes arising from payments hereceived from the Ukrainian governmentand crimes arising from his receipt of loans
11

U.S. Departmentof Justice Atterney-WorkPreduet // PrMay-Contei oMateriltect Fed Re -Crint d P-6fe)
from a bank whose CEO wasthen seeking a position in the Trump Administration); allegations that Papadopoulos committed a crime or crimes by acting as an unregistered agent of the Israeli government; and foursets of allegations involving Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisorto President Trump.
On October 20, 2017, the Acting Attorney General confirmed in a. memorandum the Special Counsel's investigative authority as to several individuals andentities. First, "as part of a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election," the Special Counsel was authorized to investigate "`the pertinent activities of Michael Cohen, Richard emeemcrsonal Privacy & Roger Stone, and
> "Confirmation of the authorization to investigate such individuals," the memorandum stressed, "does not suggest that the Special Counsel has made a determination that any of them has committed a crime." Second, with respect to Michael Cohen, the memorandum recognized the Special Counsel's authority to investigate "leads relate[d] to Cohen's establishment and use of Essential Consultants LLC to, inter alia, receive funds from Russian-backed entities." Third, the memorandum memorialized the Special Counsel's authority to investigate individuals andentities who were possibly engaged in "jointly undertaken activity" with existing subjects of the investigation, including Paul Manafort. Finally, the memorandum described an FBIinvestigation opened before the Special Counsel's appointment into "allegations that [then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions] made false statements to the United States Senate[,]" and confirmed the Special Counsel's authority to investigate that matter.
The Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority "to exerciseall investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney." 28 C.F.R. § 600.6. Like a U.S. Attorney's Office, the Special Counsel's Office considered a range of classified and unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the Office's Russia investigation, and the Office structured that work around evidencefor possible use in prosecutions of federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution). There was substantial evidence immediately available to the Special Counsel at the inception of the investigation in May 2017 because the FBI had, by that time, already investigated Russian election interference for nearly 10 months. The Special Counsel's Office exercised its judgment regarding whatto investigate anddid not, for instance, investigate every public report of a contact between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals and entities.
The Office has concludedits investigation into links and coordination between the Russian governmentand individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain proceedings associated with the Office's work remain ongoing. After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office has transferred responsibility for those remaining issues to other components of the Department of Justice and FBI. Appendix lists those transfers.
Twodistrict courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel's authority to investigate Russia election interference and links and/or coordination with the Trump Campaign. See United States v. Manafort, 312 F. Supp. 3d 60, 79-83 (D.D.C. 2018); United States v. Manafort, 321 F. Supp. 3d 640, 650-655 (E.D. Va. 2018). In the course of conducting that investigation, the Office periodically identified evidence of potential criminal activity that was outside the scope of the Special Counsel's authority established by the Acting Attorney General. After consultation with
12

U.S. Department of Justice Atterney-WerkPreduet // Protected
the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office referred that evidence to appropriate law enforcementauthorities, principally other componentsof the DepartmentofJustice and to the FBI. Appendix D summarizes thosereferrals.
eR
To carry out the investigation and prosecution of the matters assigned to him, the Special Counsel assembled a team that at its high point included 19 attorneys--five of whom joined the Office from private practice and 14 on detail or assigned from other Department of Justice components. These attorneys were assisted by a filter team of Department lawyers and FBI personnel who screened materials obtained via court process for privileged information before turning those materials over to investigators; a support staff of three paralegals on detail from the Department's Antitrust Division; and an administrative staff of nine responsible for budget, finance, purchasing, human resources, records, facilities, security, information technology, and administrative support. The Special Counsel attorneys and support staff were co-located with and worked alongside approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, a paralegal, and professional staff assigned by the FBIto assist the Special Counsel's investigation. Those "assigned" FBI employees remained under FBI supervision at all times; the matters on which they assisted were supervised by the Special Counsel.!
Duringits investigation the Office issued more than 2,800 subpoenas underthe auspices of a grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia; executed nearly 500 search-and-seizure warrants; obtained more than 230 orders for communications records under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d); obtained almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers; made 13 requests to foreign governments pursuant to Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties; and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses, including almost 80 before a grand jury.
oR Ok
From its inception, the Office recognized that its investigation could identify foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information relevant to the FBI's broader national security mission. FBI personnel whoassisted the Office established procedures to identify and convey such information to the FBI. The FBI's Counterintelligence Division met with the Office regularly for that purpose for most of the Office's tenure. For more than the past year, the FBI also embedded personnel at the Office who did not work on the Special Counsel's investigation, but whosepurpose wasto review the results of the investigation and to send--in writing--summaries of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information to FBIHQ and FBI Field Offices. Those communications and other correspondence between the Office and the FBI contain information derived from the investigation, not all of which is contained in this Volume. This Volumeis asummary. It contains, in the Office's judgment, that information necessary to account for the Special Counsel's prosecution and declination decisions and to describe the investigation's main factual results.
' BI personnel assignedto the Special Counsel's Office were required to adhereto all applicable federal law and all Department and FBI regulations, guidelines, and policies. An FBI attorney worked on FBI-related matters for the Office, such as FBI compliance with all FBI policies and procedures, including the FBI's Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG). That FBI attorney worked under FBI legal supervision, not the Special Counsel's supervision.

II. RUSSIAN "ACTIVE MEASURES" SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN The first form of Russian election influence cameprincipally from the Internet Research
Agency, LLC (IRA), a Russian organization funded by Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and companies he controlled, including Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering (collectively "Concord").? The IRA conducted social media operationstargetedat large U.S. audiences with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political system.? These operations constituted "active measures" (akTHBHEIe MeporpuaTHa), a term that typically refers to operations conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs.
The IRA and its employees began operationstargeting the United States as early as 2014. Using fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and group pages designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists. Over time, these social media accounts became a meansto reachlarge U.S. audiences. IRA employeestravelled to the United States in mid-2014 on an intelligence-gathering mission to obtain information and photographsfor use in their social mediaposts.
IRA employees posted derogatory information about a number ofcandidates in the 2016 US. presidential election. By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump Campaign anddisparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA madevarious expendituresto carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the namesof U.S. persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump Campaignand with otherpolitical activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the staging of political rallies.» The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly orintentionally coordinated with the IRA's interference operation.
By the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. persons through their social media accounts. Multiple IRA-controlled Facebook groups and

2. U.S. Operations Through IRA-Controlled Social Media Accounts Dozens of IRA employees were responsible for operating accounts and personas on different U.S. social media platforms. The IRA referred to employees assigned to operate the social media accounts as "specialists.""? Starting as early as 2014, the IRA's U.S. operations included social mediaspecialists focusing on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.'? The IRA later added specialists who operated on Tumblr and Instagram accounts. Initially, the IRA created social media accounts that pretended to be the personal accounts of U.S. persons.*" By early 2015, the IRA began to create larger social media groups or public social media pages that claimed (falsely) to be affiliated with U.S. political and grassroots organizations. In certain cases, the IRA created accounts that mimicked real U.S. organizations. For example, one IRA-controlled Twitter account, @TEN_GOP,purported to be connectedto the Tennessee Republican Party." More commonly, the IRA created accounts in the names of fictitious U.S. organizations and grassroots groups and used these accounts to pose as antiimmigration groups, Tea Party activists, Black Lives Matter protestors, and other U.S. social and political activists. The IRA closely monitored the activity of its social media accounts. Harm to Ongoing Matter

Throughout 2016, IRA accounts published an increasing number of materials supporting the Trump Campaign and opposing the Clinton Campaign. For example, on May 31, 2016, the operational account "Matt Skiber" began to privately message dozens of pro-Trump Facebook groups asking them to help plan a "pro-Trumprally near Trump Tower."
To reach larger U.S. audiences, the IRA purchased advertisements from Facebook that promoted the IRA groups onthe newsfeeds of U.S. audience members. According to Facebook, the IRA purchased over 3,500 advertisements, and the expenditures totaled approximately $100,000.°¢
During the U.S. presidential campaign, many IRA-purchased advertisements explicitly supported or opposed a presidential candidate or promoted U.S. rallies organized by the IRA (discussed below). As early as March 2016, the IRA purchased advertisements that overtly opposed the Clinton Campaign. For example, on March 18, 2016, the IRA purchased an advertisement depicting candidate Clinton and a caption that read in part, "If one day God lets this liar enter the White House as a president -- that day would be a real national tragedy."°" Similarly, on April 6, 2016, the IRA purchased advertisements for its account "Black Matters" calling for a "flashmob"of U.S. personsto "take a photo with #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 or #nohillary2016.°°° TRA-purchased advertisements featuring Clinton were, with very few exceptions, negative."
IRA-purchased advertisements referencing candidate Trump largely supported his campaign. The first known IRA advertisement explicitly endorsing the Trump Campaign was purchased on April 19, 2016. The IRA bought an advertisementfor its Instagram account "Tea Party News"asking U.S. personsto help them "makea patriotic team of young Trump supporters" by uploading photos with the hashtag "#KIDS4TRUMP."® In subsequent months, the IRA purchased dozensof advertisements supporting the Trump Campaign, predominantly through the Facebookgroups "Being Patriotic," "Stop All Invaders," and "Secured Borders."

The IRA then sent a large numberof direct messages to followers of its social media account asking them to attend the event. From those who respondedwithinterest in attending, the IRA then sought a U.S. personto serve as the event's coordinator.

Unit 74455 assisted in the release of documents stolen by Unit 26165, the promotion ofthosereleases, and the publication of anti-Clinton content on social media accounts operated by the GRU. Officers from Unit 74455 separately hacked computers belonging to state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of U.S. elections.!!*

Beginning in mid-March 2016, Unit 26165 had primary responsibility for hacking the DCCCand DNC,as well as email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign:!!>

- Unit 26165 used

to learn about

different Democratic websites, including democrats.or; , hillaryclinton.com, dnc.org, and

began before the GRU had obtained any credentials or gained access to these networks, indicating that the later DCCC and DNC intrusions were not crimes of opportunity but rather the result of targeting.!!°
- GRUofficers also sent hundreds of spearphishing emails to the work and personal email accounts of Clinton Campaign employees and volunteers. Between March 10, 2016 and March 15, 2016, Unit 26165 appears to have sent approximately 90 spearphishing emails to email accounts athillaryclinton.com. Starting on March 15, 2016, the GRU begantargeting Google email accounts used by Clinton Campaign employees, along with a smaller numberof dnc.org email accounts.!!7
The GRU spearphishing operation enabled it to gain access to numerous email accounts of Clinton Campaign employees and volunteers, including campaign chairman John Podesta, junior volunteers assigned to the Clinton Campaign's advance team, informal Clinton Campaign advisors, and a DNC employee.''® GRU officers stole tens of thousands of emails from spearphishing victims, including various Clinton Campaign-related communications.

2. Intrusions into the DCCC and DNC Networks a. Initial Access By no later than April 12, 2016, the GRU had gained access to the DCCC computer network using the credentials stolen from a DCCC employee who had been successfully spearphished the week before. Over the ensuing weeks, the GRU traversed the network, identifying different computers connected to the DCCC network. By stealing network access credentials along the way (including those of IT administrators with unrestricted access to the system), the GRU compromised approximately 29 different computers on the DCCC network.!!" Approximately six days after first hacking into the DCCC network, on April 18, 2016, GRUofficers gained access to the DNC networkvia virtual private network (VPN) connection!" between the DCCC and DNCnetworks.'?! Between April 18, 2016 and June8, 2016, Unit 26165 compromised more than 30 computers on the DNC network, including the DNC mailserver and
sharedfile server.!"
b. Implantation ofMalware on DCCC and DNC Networks Unit 26165 implanted on the DCCC and DNC networks two types of customized malware,!?? known as "X-Agent" and "X-Tunnel"; Mimikatz, a credential-harvesting tool; and rar.exe, a tool used in these intrusions to compile and compress materials for exfiltration. X-Agent was a multi-function hacking tool that allowed Unit 26165 to log keystrokes, take screenshots, and
gather other data about the infected computers (e.g., file directories, operating systems).'"* XTunnel was a hacking tool that created an encrypted connection between the victim DCCC/DNC computers and GRU-controlled computers outside the DCCC and DNC networksthat was capable oflarge-scale data transfers.!> GRU officers then used X-Tunnelto exfiltrate stolen data from the victim computers.

20 A VPN extends a private network, allowing users to send and receive data across public networks (suchasthe internet) as if the connecting computer wasdirectly connected to the private network. The VPN in this case had been created to give a small number of DCCC employees access to certain databases housed on the DNC network, Therefore, while the DCCC employees were outside the DNC's private network, they could access parts of the DNC network from their DCCC computers.

To operate X-Agent and X-Tunnel on the DCCC and DNC networks, Unit 26165 officers set up a group of computers outside those networks to communicate with the implanted malware.!*° The first set of GRU-controlled computers, known by the GRU as"middle servers," sent and received messages to and from malware on the DNC/DCCC networks. The middle servers, in turn, relayed messagesto a secondset of GRU-controlled computers, labeled internally by the GRU as an "AMSPanel."

The Arizona-based AMS Panel also stored thousands of files containing keylogging sessions captured through X-Agent. These sessions were captured as GRU officers monitored DCCC and DNCemployees' work on infected computers regularly between April 2016 and June 2016. Data captured in these keylogging sessions included passwords, internal communications between employees, banking information, and sensitive personal information.
c. Theft ofDocumentsfrom DNC and DCCC Networks Officers from Unit 26165 stole thousands of documents from the DCCC and DNC networks, including significant amounts of data pertaining to the 2016 U.S. federal elections. Stolen documents includedinternal strategy documents, fundraising data, opposition research, and emails from the work inboxes of DNC employees." The GRU beganstealing DCCCdata shortly after it gained access to the network. On April 14, 2016 (approximately three days after the initial intrusion) GRU officers downloadedrar.exe onto the DCCC's document server. The following day, the GRU searched one compromised DCCC computer for files containing search terms that included "Hillary," "DNC," "Cruz," and "Trump."3! On April 25, 2016, the GRU collected and compressed PDF and Microsoft documents from folders on the DCCC's sharedfile server that pertained to the 2016 election.'3 The GRU appears to have compressed and exfiltrated over 70 gigabytes of data from thisfile server.!*7 The GRUalso stole documents from the DNC network shortly after gaining access. On April 22, 2016, the GRU copiedfiles from the DNC network to GRU-controlled computers. Stolen documents included the DNC's opposition research into candidate Trump.' Between approximately May 25, 2016 and June 1, 2016, GRU officers accessed the DNC's mail server from a GRU-controlled computer leased inside the United States.'*° During these connections,

B. Dissemination of the Hacked Materials The GRU's operations extended beyond stealing materials, and included releasing documents stolen from the Clinton Campaign and its supporters. The GRU carried out the anonymousrelease through twofictitious online personasthat it created--DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0--andlater through the organization WikiLeaks.

Unit 26165 paid fortheregistration using a poolofbitcoin that it had mined.3* The deleaks.com landing page pointed to different tranches of stolen documents, arranged by victim or subject matter. Other dcleaks.com pages contained indexesof the stolen emails that were being released (bearing the sender, recipient, and date of the email). To control access and the timing of releases, pages were sometimes password-protected for a period of time and later made unrestricted to the public. Starting in June 2016, the GRU posted stolen documents onto the website dcleaks.com, including documentsstolen from a numberof individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign. These documents appeared to have originated from personal email accounts(in particular, Google and Microsoft accounts), rather than the DNC and DCCC computer networks. DCLeaksvictims included an advisor to the Clinton Campaign, a former DNC employee and Clinton Campaign employee, and four other campaign volunteers.'3? The GRU released through dcleaks.com thousands of documents, including personal identifying and financial information, internal correspondencerelated to the Clinton Campaign andpriorpolitical jobs, and fundraising files and

GRUofficers also used the DCLeaks Facebook account, the Twitter account @dcleaks_, and the email account dcleaksproject@gmail.com to communicate privately with reporters and other U.S. persons. GRUofficers using the DCLeaks persona gavecertain reporters early access to archives of leaked files by sending them links and passwords to pages on the dcleaks.com website that had not yet become public. For example, on July 14, 2016, GRU officers operating under the DCLeakspersonasent a link and passwordfor a non-public DCLeaks webpageto a U.S.
reporter via the Facebook account.3 Similarly, on September 14, 2016, GRU officers sent reporters Twitter direct messages from @dcleaks_, with a password to another non-public part of the dcleaks.com website."

On June 14, 2016, the DNCandits cyber-response team announced the breach of the DNC network and suspected theft of DNC documents. In the statements, the cyber-response team alleged that Russian state-sponsored actors (which they referred to as "Fancy Bear') were responsible for the breach.'*° Apparently in response to that announcement, on June 15, 2016, GRUofficers using the persona Guccifer 2.0 created a WordPress blog. In the hours leading up to the launch of that WordPress blog, GRU officers logged into a Moscow-based server used and managed by Unit 74455 and searched for a number of specific words and phrases in English, including "some hundred sheets," "illuminati," and "worldwide known." Approximately two hoursafter the last of those searches, Guccifer 2.0 published its first post, attributing the DNC server hack to a lone Romanian hackerand using several of the unique English words and phrases that the GRU officers had searchedfor that day.'"

That sameday, June 15, 2016, the GRU also used the Guccifer 2.0 WordPress blog to begin releasing to the public documents stolen from the DNC and DCCC computer networks. The Guccifer 2.0 persona ultimately released thousands of documents stolen from the DNC and DCCC in a series of blog posts between June 15, 2016 and October 18, 2016.'47 Released documents included opposition research performed by the DNC (including a memorandum analyzing potential criticisms of candidate Trump),internal policy documents (such as recommendations on how to address politically sensitive issues), analyses of specific congressional races, and fundraising documents. Releases were organized around thematic issues, such as specific states (e.g., Florida and Pennsylvania) that were perceived as competitive in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Beginning in late June 2016, the GRU also used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to release documents directly to reporters and other interested individuals. Specifically, on June 27, 2016, Guccifer 2.0 sent an email to the news outlet The Smoking Gun offering to provide "exclusive access to some leaked emails linked [to] Hillary Clinton's staff."'*® The GRUlater sent the reporter a password and link to a locked portion of the dcleaks.com website that contained an archiveof emails stolen by Unit 26165 from a Clinton Campaign volunteer in March 2016.'? That the Guccifer 2.0 persona provided reporters accessto a restricted portion of the DCLeaks website tends to indicate that both personas were operated by the same or a closely-related group of people.!*°
The GRU continued its release efforts through Guccifer 2.0 into August 2016. For example, on August 15, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a candidate for the U.S. Congress documents related to the candidate's opponent.'*! On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona transferred approximately 2.5 gigabytes of Florida-related data stolen from the DCCC to a U.S. blogger covering Florida politics.'°* On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a U.S. reporter documents stolen from the DCCCpertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement.!°?

3. Use of WikiLeaks

In order to expandits interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the GRU units transferred many of the documents they stole from the DNC and the chairman of the Clinton Campaign to WikiLeaks. GRU officers used both the DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 personas to communicate with WikiLeaks through Twitter private messaging and through encrypted channels, including possibly through WikiLeaks's private communication system.

a. WikiLeaks's Expressed Opposition Toward the Clinton Campaign

WikiLeaks, and particularly its founder Julian Assange, privately expressed opposition to candidate Clinton well before the first release of stolen documents. In November 2015, Assange wrote to other members and associates of WikiLeaks that "[w]e believe it would be much better for GOP to win... Dems+Media+liberals woud][sic] then form a block to reign in their worst qualities.... With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities., dems+media+neoliberals will be mute. ... She's a bright, well connected, sadisitic sociopath." !°°

In March 2016, WikiLeaks released a searchable archive of approximately 30,000 Clinton emails that had been obtained through FOIA litigation.'5? While designing the archive, one WikiLeaks memberexplained the reason for building the archive to anotherassociate:

eHarm to Ongoing Matter '56 11/19/15 Twitter Group Chat, Group ID 594242937858486276, @WikiLeakset al. Assange also wrote that, "GOP will generate a lot oposition [sic], including through dumb moves. Hillary will do the same thing, but co-optthe liberal opposition and the GOP opposition. Hencehillary has greater freedom to start wars than the GOP andhasthe will to do so."

Firstly because its useful and will annoy Hillary, but secondly because we want to be seen to be a resource/player in the US election, becauseeit [sic] may en[]courage people to send us even more important leaks.'*8
b. WikiLeaks's First Contact with Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks Shortly after the GRU's first release of stolen documents through dcleaks.com in June 2016, GRU officers also used the DCLeaks persona to contact WikiLeaks about possible coordination in the future release of stolen emails. On June 14, 2016, @dcleaks_ sent a direct message to @WikiLeaks, noting, "You announced your organization was preparing to publish more Hillary's emails. We are ready to support you. We have somesensitive information too,in
a i d Ta Technique particular, her financial documents. Let's do it together. What do you think about publishing our
Around the same time, WikiLeaks initiated communications with the GRU persona Guccifer 2.0 shortly after it was used to release documents stolen from the DNC. On June 22, 2016, seven days after Guccifer 2.0's first releases of stolen DNC documents, WikiLeaks used Twitter's direct message function to contact the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter account and suggest that Guccifer 2.0 "[s]end any new material [stolen from the DNC] herefor usto review andit will have a muchhigher impact than what you are doing."!°
On July 6, 2016, WikiLeaks again contacted Guccifer 2.0 through Twitter's private messaging function, writing, "if you have anythinghillary related we wantit in the next tweo[sic] days prefable [sic] because the DNCis approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind her after." The Guccifer 2.0 persona responded, "ok...i see." WikiLeaks also explained, "we think trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary . . . so conflict between bernie and hillary is interesting."!*!
c. The GRU's Transfer ofStolen Materials to WikiLeaks Both the GRU and WikiLeaks soughtto hide their communications, which has limited the Office's ability to collect all of the communications between them. Thus, althoughit is clear that the stolen DNC and Podesta documents were transferred from the GRU to WikiLeaks,

WikiLeaks Statements Dissembling About the Source ofStolen Materials As reports attributing the DNC and DCCC hacks to the Russian government emerged, WikiLeaks and Assange made severalpublic statements apparently designed to obscure the source of the materials that WikiLeaks was releasing. The file-transfer evidence described above and other information uncovered during the investigation discredit WikiLeaks's claims about the source of material that it posted. Beginning in the summer of 2016, Assange and WikiLeaks made a numberof statements about Seth Rich, a former DNC staff member whowaskilled in July 2016. The statements about Rich implied falsely that he had beenthe source of the stolen DNC emails. On August 9, 2016, the @WikiLeaks Twitter account posted: "ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a
US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNCstaffer Seth Rich."!®
Likewise, on August 25, 2016, Assange wasasked in an interview, "Why are you so interested in Seth Rich's killer?" and responded, "We're very interested in anything that might be a threat to alleged Wikileaks sources." The interviewer responded to Assange's statement by commenting, "I know you don't wantto reveal yoursource,butit certainly soundslike you're suggesting a man wholeaked information to WikiLeaks was then murdered." Assangereplied, "If there's someone who's potentially connected to our publication, and that person has been murdered in suspicious

circumstances, it doesn't necessarily mean that the two are connected. Butit is a very serious matter...that type of allegation is very serious,asit's taken very seriously by us?!

After the U.S. intelligence community publicly announcedits assessment that Russia was behind the hacking operation, Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released by WikiLeaks had come from Russian hacking. According to media reports, Assange told a U.S. congressmanthat the DNC hack was an"inside job," and purported to have "physical proof"that Russians did notgive materials to Assange.'*?

C. Additional GRU Cyber Operations

While releasing the stolen emails and documents through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and WikiLeaks, GRU officers continued to target and hackvictimslinked to the Democratic campaign and, eventually, to target entities responsible for election administration in severalstates.

1. Summerand Fall 2016 Operations Targeting Democrat-Linked Victims

On July 27, 2016, Unit 26165 targeted email accounts connected to candidate Clinton's personal office Na Earlier that day, candidate Trump made public statements that included the following: "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."'®? The "30,000 emails" were apparently a reference to emails described in media accounts as having been stored on a personalserver that candidate Clinton had used while serving as Secretary of State.

Within approximately five hours of Trump's statement, GRU officers targeted forthefirst time Clinton's personal office. After candidate Trump's remarks, Unit 26165 created and sent malicious links targeting 15 email accounts at the domain eae including an email account belonging to Clinton rid The investigation did not find evidenceofearlier GRUattempts to compromise accounts hosted on this domain. It is unclear how the GRU was able to identify these email accounts, which were not public.!*4

Unit 26165 officers also hacked into a DNC account hosted on a cloud-computing service

On September 20, 2016, the GRU began to generate

copies of the DNCdatausin

function designed to allow users to produce backups of

databases (referred to

as "snapshots"). The GRU then stole those snapshots by moving

them to Es account that they controlled; from there, the copies were moved to GRUcontrolled computers. The GRUstole approximately 300 gigabytes of data from the DNC cloud-
based account.!85

2. Intrusions Targeting the Administration of U.S. Elections

In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRUofficers also targeted individuals andentities involved in the administration of the elections. Victims included USS. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities.'8 The GRU also targeted private technologyfirmsresponsible for manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware, such as voterregistration software and electronic polling stations.'®" The GRUcontinued to target these victims through the elections in November 2016. While the investigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office did not investigate further. The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examineservers or other relevant items belonging to these victims. The Office understands that the FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity.

Byat least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer networksby exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental entities. GRUofficers, for example, targeted state and local databases ofregistered voters using a technique known as "SQL injection," by which malicious code was sent to the state or local website in order to run commands(such as exfiltrating the database contents).'** In one instance in approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois State Board of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE's website. The GRU then gained access to a database containing information on millions of registered Illinois voters,!® and extracted data related to thousands ofU.S. voters before the malicious activity was identified.!"°

Unit 74455 also sent spearphishing emails to public officials involved in election administration and personnel at companiesinvolved in voting technology. In August 2016, GRU officers targeted employees a. a voting technology companythat developed software used by numerous U.S. counties to managevoter rolls, and installed malware on the company network. Similarly, in November 2016, the GRU sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election.'*! The spearphishing emails contained an attached Word document coded with malicious software (commonly referred to as a Trojan) that permitted the GRU to access the infected computer.'" The FBI wasseparately responsible for this investigation. We understand the FBI believesthat this operation enabled the GRU to gain access to the network of at least one Florida county government. The Office did not independently verify that belief and, as explained above, did not undertake the investigative steps that would have been necessary to do so.

2. Other Potential Campaign Interest in Russian Hacked Materials Throughout 2016, the Trump Campaign expressed interest in Hillary Clinton's private email server and whether approximately 30,000 emails from that server had in fact been permanently destroyed, as reported by the media. Several individuals associated with the Campaign were contacted in 2016 about various efforts to obtain the missing Clinton emails and other stolen material in support of the Trump Campaign. Someof these contacts were met with skepticism, and nothing cameof them; others were pursued to some degree. The investigation did not find evidence that the Trump Campaign recovered any such Clinton emails, or that these contacts were part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the Trump Campaign.
a. Henry Oknyansky (a/k/a Henry Greenberg) In the spring of 2016, Trump Campaign advisor Michael Caputo learned through a Floridabased Russian business partner that another Florida-based Russian, Henry Oknyansky (whoalso went by the name Henry Greenberg), claimed to have information pertaining to Hillary Clinton. Caputo notified Roger Stone and brokered communication between Stone and Oknyansky. Oknyansky and Stone set up a May 2016 in-person meeting? Oknyansky was accompanied to the meeting by Alexei Rasin, a Ukrainian associate involved in Florida real estate. At the meeting, Rasin offered to sell Stone derogatory information on Clinton that Rasin claimed to have obtained while working for Clinton. Rasin claimed to possess financial statements demonstrating Clinton's involvement in money laundering with Rasin's companies. According to Oknyansky, Stone asked if the amounts in question totaled millions of dollars but was told it was closer to hundreds of thousands. Stone refused the offer, stating that Trump would not pay for opposition research.°! Oknyansky claimed to the Office that Rasin's motivation was financial. According to Oknyansky, Rasin had tried unsuccessfully to shop the Clinton information around to other interested parties, and Oknyansky would receive a cut if the information was sold.2 Rasin is noted in public source documents as the director and/or registered agent for a numberofFlorida companies, none of which appears to be connected to Clinton. The Office foundno other evidence that Rasin worked for Clinton or any Clinton-related entities. In their statementsto investigators, Oknyansky and Caputo had contradictory recollections about the meeting. Oknyansky claimed that Caputo accompanied Stone to the meeting and provided an introduction, whereas Caputo did nottell us that he had attended and claimed that he was never told what information Oknyansky offered. Caputo also stated that he was unaware Oknyansky soughtto be paid for the information until Stone inforrned him after the fact.

The Office did not locate Rasin in the United States, although the Office confirmed Rasin had been issued a Florida driver's license. The Office otherwise was unable to determine the content andorigin of the information he purportedly offered to Stone. Finally, the investigation did not identify evidence of a connection between the outreach or the meeting and Russian interferenceefforts.
b. Campaign Efforts to Obtain Deleted Clinton Emails After candidate Trump stated on July 27, 2016, that he hoped Russia would "find the 30,000 emails that are missing," Trump asked individuals affiliated with his Campaignto find the deleted Clinton emails.*** Michael Flynn--who wouldlater serve as National Security Advisor in the Trump Administration--recalled that Trump made this request repeatedly, and Flynn subsequently contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails.2% Barbara Ledeen and Peter Smith were among the people contacted by Flynn. Ledeen, a long-time Senate staffer who had previously sought the Clinton emails, provided updates to Flynn about herefforts throughout the summer of 2016.2Smith, an investment advisor who wasactive in Republican politics, also attemptedto locate and obtain the deleted Clinton emails.267 Ledeen beganherefforts to obtain the Clinton emails before Flynn's request, as early as December 2015.2 On December 3, 2015, she emailed Smith a proposal to obtain the emails, stating, "Here is the proposalI briefly mentioned to you. The person I described to you would be happyto talk with you either in person or over the phone. The person can get the emails which 1. Wereclassified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies. That would demonstrate what needs to be
demonstrated."
Attached to the email was a 25-page proposal stating that the "Clinton email server was, in all likelihood, breached long ago," and that the Chinese, Russian, andIranian intelligence services could "re-assemble the server's email content."?"" The proposalcalled for a three-phase approach. Thefirst two phases consisted of open-source analysis. The third phase consisted of checking with certain intelligence sources "that have access through liaison work with various foreign services" to determine if any of those services had gotten to the server. The proposal noted, "Even if a single email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would be catastrophic to the Clinton campaign[.]" Smith forwarded the email to two colleagues and

wrote, "we can discuss to whom it should be referred."""! On December 16, 2015, Smith informed
Ledeen that he declined to participate in her "initiative." According to one of Smith's business associates, Smith believed Ledeen's initiative was not viableat that time.?"
Just weeks after Trump's July 2016 request to find the Clinton emails, however, Smith tried to locate and obtain the emails himself. He created a company, raised tens of thousands of dollars, and recruited security experts and business associates. Smith made claims to others involved in the effort (and those from whom hesought funding) that he was in contact with hackers with "ties and affiliations to Russia" who had access to the emails, and that his efforts were coordinated with the Trump Campaign.??
On August 28, 2016, Smith sent an email from an encrypted account with the subject "Sec.

The email stated that Smith was "[j]ust finishing two daysof sensitive meetings here in DC with involved groups to poke and probe on the above. It is clear that the Clinton's home-based, unprotected server was hacked with ease by both State-related players, and private mercenaries. Parties with varying interests, are circling to release ahead of the election."
On September2, 2016, Smith directed a business associate to establish KLS Research LLC in furtheranceofhis search for the deleted Clinton emails." One of the purposes of KLS Research was to manage the funds Smith raised in support ofhis initiative.7"° KLS Research received over $30,000 during the presidential campaign, although Smith represented that he raised even more

and Kellyanne Conway."*° The investigation established that Smith communicated with at least Flynn and Clovis about his search for the deleted Clinton emails,"*! but the Office did not identify evidence that any ofthelisted individuals initiated or directed Smith's efforts.
In September 2016, Smith and Ledeen got back in touch with each other about their respective efforts. Ledeen wrote to Smith, "wondering if you had some moredetailed reports or memos orother data you could share because we have come a long wayin our efforts since we last visited... . We would need as much technical discussion as possible so we could marryit against the new data we have found and then could shareit back to you `your eyes only,'"282
Ledeen claimed to have obtained a trove of emails (from what she described as the "dark web") that purported to be the deleted Clinton emails. Ledeen wanted to authenticate the emails and solicited contributionsto fundthat effort. Erik Prince provided fundingto hire a tech advisor to ascertain the authenticity of the emails. According to Prince, the tech advisor determined that
the emails were not authentic.28 A backup of Smith's computer contained two files that had been downloaded from
WikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta. Thefiles on Smith's computerhad creation dates of October 2, 2016, which waspriorto the date of their release by WikiLeaks. Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect whenthefiles were downloaded to Smith's computer. (It appears the creation date was when WikiLeaks staged the documentfor release, as discussed in VolumeI, Section III.B.3.c, supra.?*4) The investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their release by WikiLeaks.
Smith continued to send emails to an undisclosed recipient list about Clinton's deleted emails until shortly before the election. For example, on October 28, 2016, Smith wrote that there wasa "tug-of-war going on within WikiLeaks overits planned releases in the next few days," and that WikiLeaks "has maintained that it will save its best revelations for last, under the theory this allowslittle time for response prior to the U.S. election November 8."78 An attachment to the

See VolumeI, Section III.B.3.c, supra. The Office tested this theory in March 2019 by downloading the two files found on Smith's computer from WikiLeaks's site using the same Apple operating system on Smith's computer; both files were successfully

email claimed that WikiLeaks would release "All 33k deleted Emails" by "NovemberIst." No emails obtained from Clinton's server were subsequently released.
Smith drafted multiple emails stating or intimating that he was in contact with Russian hackers. For example, in one such email, Smith claimedthat, in August 2016, KLS Research had organized meetings with parties who hadaccessto the deleted Clinton emails, including parties with "ties andaffiliations to Russia."**° The investigation did not identify evidence that any such meetings occurred. Associates and security experts who worked with Smith on theinitiative did not believe that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers and were aware of no such connection.2*' The investigation did not establish that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers or that Smith, Ledeen,or other individuals in touch with the Trump Campaignultimately obtained the deleted Clinton emails.

In sum,the investigation established that the GRU hacked into email accounts of persons

affiliated with the Clinton Campaign,as well as the computers of the DNC and DCCC. The GRU

then exfiltrated data related to the 2016 election from these accounts and computers, and

disseminated that data through fictitious online personas (DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0) and later

through WikiLeaks. The investigation also established that the Trump Ca

IV. RUSSIAN GOVERNMENTLINKS To AND CONTACTS WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN The Office identified multiple contacts--"links,"in the words of the Appointment Order--
between Trump Campaignofficials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The Office investigated whether those contacts constituted a third avenue of attempted Russian interference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election. In particular, the investigation examined whether these contacts involved orresulted in coordination or a conspiracy with the Trump Campaign and Russia, including with respect to Russia providing assistance to the Campaign in exchangefor anysort of favorable treatment in the future. Based on the available information, the investigation did not establish such coordination.
This Section describes the principal links between the Trump Campaign and individuals with ties to the Russian government, including some contacts with Campaign officials or associates that have been publicly reported to involve Russian contacts. Each subsection begins with an overview of the Russian contact at issue and then describesin detail the relevant facts, which are generally presented in chronological order, beginning with the early months of the Campaign and extending throughthe post-election, transition period.
A. Campaign Period (September 2015 -- November8, 2016) Russian-government-connected individuals and media entities began showinginterest in Trump's campaign in the months after he announced his candidacy in June 2015.78° Because Trump's status as a public figure at the time wasattributable in large part to his prior business and entertainment dealings, this Office investigated whether a business contact with Russia-linked individuals and entities during the campaign period--the Trump Tower Moscow project, see VolumeI, Section IV.A.1, infra--led to or involved coordination ofelection assistance. Outreach from individuals with ties to Russia continuedin the spring and summerof 2016, when Trump was moving toward--and eventually becoming--the Republican nominee for President. As set forth below, the Office also evaluated a series of links during this period: outreach to two of Trump's then-recently named foreign policy advisors, including a representation that Russia had "dirt" on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails (VolumeI, Sections IV.A.2 & IV.A.3); dealings with a D.C.-basedthink tank that specializes in Russia and has connections with its government (Volume I, Section IV.A.4); a meeting at Trump Tower between the Campaign and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on candidate Clinton that was "part of Russia and its government's support for [Trump]" (Volume I, Section IV.A.5); events at the Republican National Convention (VolumeI, Section IV.A.6); post-Convention contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia's ambassador to the United States (Volume I, Section IV.A.7); and contacts through campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had previously worked for a Russianoligarch and a pro-Russianpolitical party in Ukraine (VolumeI, Section IV.A.8).
288 For example, on August 18, 2015, on behalf of the editor-in-chief of the internet newspaper Vzglyad, Georgi Asatryan emailed campaign press secretary Hope Hicks asking for a phoneor in-person candidate interview. 8/18/15 Email, Asatryan to Hicks. One day earlier, the publication's founder (and former Russian parliamentarian) Konstantin Rykov had registered two Russian websites--Trump2016.ru and DonaldTrump2016.ru. Nointerview tookplace.

1. Trump Tower Moscow Project The Trump Organization has pursued and completed projects outside the United States as part of its real estate portfolio. Some projects have involved the acquisition and ownership (through subsidiary corporate structures) of property. In other cases, the Trump Organization has executed licensing deals with real estate developers and management companies,oftenlocalto the
country where the project waslocated. Between atleast 2013 and 2016, the Trump Organization explored a similarlicensing deal
in Russia involving the construction of a Trump-branded property in Moscow. The project, commonlyreferred to as a "Trump Tower Moscow"or "Trump Moscow"project, anticipated a combination of commercial, hotel, and residential properties all within the same building. Between 2013 and June 2016, several employees of the Trump Organization, including thenpresident of the organization Donald J. Trump, pursued a Moscow deal with several Russian counterparties. From thefall of 2015 until the middle of 2016, Michael Cohen spearheaded the Trump Organization's pursuit of a Trump Tower Moscow project, including by reporting on the project's status to candidate Trumpandother executivesin the Trump Organization."
a. Trump Tower Moscow Venture with the Crocus Group (2013-2014) The Trump Organization and the Crocus Group, a Russian real estate conglomerate owned and controlled by Aras Agalarov, began discussing a Russia-basedreal estate project shortly after the conclusion of the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.2*! Donald J. Trump Jr. served as the primary negotiator on behalf of the Trump Organization; Emin Agalarov (son of Aras Agalarov) and Irakli "Ike" Kaveladze represented the Crocus Group during negotiations," with
the occasionalassistance of Robert Goldstone." In December 2013, Kaveladze and Trump Jr. negotiated and signed preliminary terms of

Theparties negotiateda letter of intent during January and February 2014.2"
From January 2014 through November 2014, the Trump Organization and Crocus Group discussed development plans for the Moscow project. Some time before January 24, 2014,the Crocus Group sent the Trump Organization a proposal for a 800-unit, 194-meter building to be constructed at an Agalarov-ownedsite in Moscowcalled "Crocus City," which had also beenthe site of the Miss Universe pageant.2°7 In February 2014, Ivanka Trump met with Emin Agalarov and toured the CrocusCity site during a visit to Moscow."* From March 2014 through July 2014, the groups discussed "design standards" and otherarchitectural elements.""? For example,in July 2014, membersof the Trump Organization sent Crocus Group counterparties questions about the "demographics of these prospective buyers" in the Crocus City area, the development of neighboring parcels in Crocus City, and concepts for redesigning portionsof the building." In August 2014,the Trump Organization requested specifications for a competing Marriott-branded tower beingbuilt in Crocus City"!
Beginning in September 2014, the Trump Organization stopped responding in a timely fashion to correspondenceand proposals from the Crocus Group.°? Communications between the two groups continued through November 2014 with decreasing frequency; what appears to be the last communication is dated November 24, 2014.2The project appears not to have developed past the planning stage, and no construction occurred.

b. Communications with I.C. Expert Investment Company and Giorgi Rtskhiladze (Summerand Fall 2015)
In the late summer of 2015, the Trump Organization received a new inquiry about pursuing a Trump Towerproject in Moscow. In approximately September 2015, Felix Sater, a New Yorkbased real estate advisor, contacted Michael Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump.° Sater had previously worked with the Trump Organization and advisedit on a number of domestic and international projects. Sater had explored the possibility of a Trump Tower project in Moscow while working with the Trump Organization and therefore knew of the organization's general interest in completing a deal there.Sater had also served as an informal agent of the Trump Organization in Moscow previously and had accompanied Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. to Moscow in the mid-
2000s.7%
Sater contacted Cohen on behalf of I.-C. Expert Investment Company (J.C. Expert), a Russian real-estate developmentcorporation controlled by Andrei Vladimirovich Rozov.*°' Sater had known Rozov since approximately 2007 and, in 2014, had served as an agent on behalf of Rozov during Rozov's purchase ofa building in New YorkCity.*°* Sater later contacted Rozov and proposedthat I.C. Expert pursue a Trump Tower Moscowproject in which I.C. Expert would license the name and brand from the Trump Organization but construct the building on its own. Sater worked on the deal with Rozov and another employeeofI.C. Expert.3"
Cohen was the only Trump Organization representative to negotiate directly with I.C. Expert or its agents. In approximately September 2015, Cohenobtained approval to negotiate with I.C. Expert from candidate Trump, who wasthen president of the Trump Organization. Cohen provided updates directly to Trump about the project throughout 2015 and into 2016,assuring him the project was continuing.*!° Cohen also discussed the Trump Moscow project with Ivanka Trumpas to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the project*'') and Donald J.

Also during the fall of 2015, Cohen communicated about the Trump Moscowproposalwith Giorgi Rtskhiladze, a business executive whopreviously had been involved in a developmentdeal with the Trump Organization in Batumi, Georgia.?!? Cohen stated that he spoke to Rtskhiladze in part because Rtskhiladze had pursued business ventures in Moscow,including a licensing deal with the Agalarov-owned Crocus Group.*!4 On September 22, 2015, Cohen forwarded a preliminary design study for the Trump Moscowproject to Rtskhiladze, adding "I look forward to your reply aboutthis spectacular project in Moscow." Rtskhiladze forwarded Cohen's email to an associate and wrote, "[i]f we could organize the meeting in New Yorkat the highest level of the Russian Government and Mr. Trumpthis project would definitely receive the worldwide attention."3!5
On September 24, 2015, Rtskhiladze sent Cohen an attachment that he described as a proposed "[I]etter to the Mayor of Moscow from Trumporg,"explaining that "[w]e need to send this letter to the Mayor of Moscow (second guy in Russia) he is aware ofthe potential project and will pledge his support."3!® In a second email to Cohen sent the same day, Rtskhiladze provided a translation of the letter, which described the Trump Moscow project as a "symbolof stronger economic, business and cultural relationships between New York and Moscow andtherefore United States and the Russian Federation."?!'

However, Cohen recalled conversations with Trump in which the candidate suggested that his campaign would be significant "infomercial" for Trump-branded properties.???
ii, Post-LOI Contacts with Individuals in Russia Giventhesize ofthe Trump Moscowproject, Sater and Cohenbelieved the project required approval (whether expressor implicit) from the Russian national government, including from the
Presidential Administration of Russia.*7° Sater stated that he therefore began to contact the Presidential Administration through another Russian business contact.?3!

Ivanka Trump forwarded the email to Cohen.**° Hetold the Office that, after receiving this inquiry, he had conducted an internet search for Klokov's name and concluded(incorrectly) that Klokov was a former Olympic weightlifter?
Between November 18 and 19, 2015, Klokov and Cohen hadat least one telephonecall and exchanged several emails. Describing himself in emails to Cohen as a "trusted person" who could offer the Campaign "political synergy" and "synergy on a governmentlevel," Klokov recommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified intermediary. Klokov said that those conversations could facilitate a later meeting in Russia between the candidate and an individual Klokov described as "our person ofinterest.'37 In an email to the Office, Erchovalater identified the "person of interest" as Russian President Vladimir Putin.***
In the telephone call and follow-on emails with Klokov, Cohen discussed his desire to use a near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscowproject with local . developers. Cohen registered his willingness also to meet with Klokov and the unidentified intermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate Trump-- including a possible meeting between candidate Trump and Putin--would need to be "in conjunction with the developmentandan official visit" with the Trump Organization receiving a formal invitation to visit.? (Klokov had written previously that "the visit [by candidate Trump
to Russia] has to be informal.")*"° Klokovhadalso previously recommendedto Cohen that he separate their negotiations over
a possible meeting between Trumpand"the personofinterest" from any existing businesstrack.*"! Re-emphasizing that his outreach was not done onbehalfof any business, Klokov added in second email to Cohen that, if publicized well, such a meeting could have "phenomenal" impact "in a business dimension" and that the "person of interest['s]" "most important support" could have significant ramificationsfor the "level of projects and their capacity." Klokov concluded bytelling

Cohen that there was "no bigger warranty in any project than [the] consent of the person of interest."*4? Cohen rejected the proposal, saying that "[cJurrently our LOI developeris in talks with VP's Chiefof Staff and arranging a formalinvite for the two to meet."*43_ This email appears to be their final exchange, and the investigation did not identify evidence that Cohen brought Klokov's initial offer of assistance to the Campaign's attention or that anyone associated with the Trump Organization or the Campaign dealt with Klokov at a later date. Cohen explained that he did not pursue the proposed meeting because he wasalready working on the Moscow Project with Sater, who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.*44
By late December 2015, however, Cohen was complaining that Sater had not been able to use those connectionsto set up the promised meeting with Russian governmentofficials. Cohen told Sater that he was "setting up the meeting myself."*4° On January 11, 2016, Cohen emailed the office of Dmitry Peskov, the Russian government's press secretary, indicating that he desired contact with Sergei Ivanov, Putin's chief of staff. Cohen erroneously used the email address "Pr_peskova@prpress.gof.ru" instead of "Pr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru," so the email apparently did not go through." On January 14, 2016, Cohen emailed a different address (info@prpress.gov.ru) with the following message:
Dear Mr. Peskov, Overthe past few months, I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower-Moscowproject in Moscow City. Without getting into lengthy specifics, the communication between our two sides has stalled. As this project is too important, 1 am hereby requesting yourassistance. I respectfully request someone, preferably you; contact me so that I might discuss the specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals. I thank you in advancefor yourassistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.3*7 Twodays later, Cohen sent an email to Pr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru, repeating his request to speak
with Sergei Ivanov.2#8 Cohentestified to Congress, andinitially told the Office, that he did not recall receiving a
response to this email inquiry and that he decided to terminate any further work on the Trump Moscow project as of January 2016. Cohenlater admitted that these statements were false. In

fact, Cohen had received (and recalled receiving) a response to his inquiry, and he continued to work on and update candidate Trump onthe project through as late as June 2016.
On January 20, 2016, Cohen received an email from Elena Poliakova, Peskov's personal assistant. Writing from her personal email account, Poliakova stated that she had beentrying to reach Cohen and asked thathe call her on the personal number that she provided.' Shortly after receiving Poliakova's email, Cohen called and spoketo her for 20 minutes.*>! Cohen described to Poliakova his position at the Trump Organization and outlined the proposed Trump Moscow project, including information about the Russian counterparty with which the Trump Organization had partnered. Cohen requested assistance in movingthe project forward, both in securing landto build the project and with financing. According to Cohen, Poliakova asked detailed questions and took notes, stating that she would needto follow up with others in Russia.*>
Cohen could not recall any direct follow-up from Poliakova or from any other representative of the Russian government, nor did the Office identify any evidence of direct follow-up. However, the day after Cohen's call with Poliakova, Sater texted Cohen, asking him to "[c]all me when you have a few minutesto chat . . . It's about Putin they called today."°*?

d. Discussions about Russia Travel by Michael Cohen or Candidate Trump (December 2015-June 2016) i. Sater's Overtures to Cohen to Travel to Russia
The late January communication was neither the first nor the last time that Cohen contemplated visiting Russia in pursuit of the Trump Moscow project. Beginning in late 2015, Sater repeatedly tried to arrange for Cohen and candidate Trump,as representatives of the Trump Organization,to travel to Russia to meet with Russian governmentofficials and possible financing partners. In December 2015, Sater sent Cohen a numberof emails aboutlogistics for traveling to Russia for meetings.>°° On December19, 2015, Sater wrote:
Please call me I have Evgeney [Dvoskin] on the other line.[*°*] He needs a copy ofyour and Donald's passports they need a scan of every page of the passports. Invitations & Visas will be issued this week by VIB Bankto discuss financing for Trump Tower Moscow.

office.3? The investigation did not, however, establish that the passport was forwardedto Sater. Into the spring of 2016, Sater and Cohen continued to discuss a trip to Moscow in
connection with the Trump Moscowproject. On April 20, 2016, Sater wrote Cohen, "[t]he People wanted to know whenyou are coming?"On May 4, 2016, Sater followed up:
I had a chat with Moscow. ASSUMINGthetrip does happenthe question is before or after the convention. I said I believe, but don't know for sure, that's it's probably after the convention. Obviously the pre-meetingtrip (you only) can happen anytime you wantbut the 2 big guys where [sic] the question. I said I would confirm and revert.... Let me know aboutIf I was right by saying I believe after Cleveland and also when you wantto speakto them andpossibly fly over Cohen responded, "My trip before Cleveland. Trump once he becomes the nominee after the convention." The day after this exchange, Sater tied Cohen's travel to Russia to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum ("Forum"), an annual event attended by prominent Russian politicians and businessmen. Sater told the Office that he was informed by a business associate that Peskov wanted to invite Cohen to the Forum.*6" On May 5, 2016, Sater wrote to Cohen: Peskov would like to invite you as his guest to the St. Petersburg Forum whichis Russia's Davosit's June 16-19. He wants to meet there with you and possibly introduce you to either Putin or Medvedev, as they are not sure if 1 or both will be there. This is perfect. The entire business class of Russia will be there as well. He said anything you want to discuss including dates and subjects are on the table to discuss[.]°% The following day, Sater asked Cohen to confirm those dates would work for him to travel; Cohen wrote back, "[w]Jorks for me."3

On June 9, 2016, Sater sent Cohen a notice that he (Sater) was completing the badgesfor the Forum, adding, "Putin is there on the 17th very strong chance you will meet him as well." On June 13, 2016, Sater forwarded Cohenaninvitation to the Forum signed by the Director of the Roscongress Foundation, the Russian entity organizing the Forum"! Sater also sent Cohen a Russian visa application and asked him to send two passport photos." According to Cohen,the invitation gave no indication that Peskov had beeninvolvedin inviting him. Cohen was concerned that Russianofficials were not actually involved or were not interested in meeting with him (as Sater had alleged), and so he decided not to go to the Forum.>" On June 14, 2016, Cohen met Sater in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York and informed him that he would not be traveling at that time.?>"
ii. Candidate Trump's Opportunities to Travel to Russia
The investigation identified evidence that, during the period the Trump Moscowproject was under consideration, the possibility of candidate Trumpvisiting Russia arose in two contexts.
First, in interviews with the Office, Cohenstated that he discussed the subjectof traveling to Russia with Trump twice: oncein late 2015; and again in spring 2016.7° According to Cohen, Trumpindicated a willingnessto travelif it would assist the project significantly. On one occasion, Trump told Cohen to speak with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowskito coordinate the candidate's schedule. Cohenrecalled that he spoke with Lewandowski, who suggested that they speak again when Cohen hadactual dates to evaluate. Cohen indicated, however, that he knew that travel prior to the Republican National Convention would be impossible given the candidate's preexisting commitments to the Campaign."
Second,like Cohen, Trump received and turned downaninvitation to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. In late December 2015, Mira Duma--acontact of Ivanka Trump's from the fashion industry--first passed along invitations for Ivanka Trump and candidate Trump from Sergei Prikhodko, a Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.>"" On January 14, 2016, Rhona Graff sent an email to Dumastating that Trump was "honored to be asked to participate in the highly prestigious" Forum event, but that he would "have to decline" the invitation given his "very grueling and full travel schedule"as a presidential candidate.2"* Graff

asked Duma whether she recommendedthat Graff "send a formal note to the Deputy Prime Minister" declininghis invitation; Dumareplied that a formal note would be "great."3"
It does not appear that Graffprepared that note immediately. According to written answers from President Trump,*®° Graff received an email from Deputy Prime Minister Prikhodko on March17, 2016, again inviting Trumpto participate in the 2016 Forumin St. Petersburg.**' Two weeks later, on March 31, 2016, Graff prepared for Trump's signature a two-paragraphletter declining the invitation>® The letter stated that Trump's "schedule has become extremely demanding" becauseof the presidential campaign, that he "already ha[d] several commitments in the United States"for the time of the Forum,but that he otherwise "would have gladly given every consideration to attending such an important event."2°? Graff forwarded the letter to another executive assistant at the Trump Organization with instructionsto print the documenton letterhead for Trump to sign.?**
At approximately the same time that the letter was being prepared, Robert Foresman--a New York-based investment banker--beganreaching out to Graff to secure an in-person meeting with candidate Trump. According to Foresman,he had been asked by Anton Kobyakov, a Russian presidential aide involved with the Roscongress Foundation, to see if Trump could speakat the Forum.28 Foresman first emailed Graff on March 31, 2016, following a phone introduction brokered through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who producedthe television show The Apprentice). In his email, Foresman referenced his long-standing personal and professional expertise in Russia and Ukraine,his worksetting up an early "private channel" between Vladimir Putin and former U.S. President George W. Bush,andan "approach"he had received from "senior Kremlin officials" about the candidate. Foresman asked Graff for a meeting with the candidate, Corey Lewandowski, or "another relevant person" to discuss this and other "concrete things" Foresman felt uncomfortable discussing over "unsecure email."On April 4, 2016, Graff forwarded Foresman's meeting request to Jessica Macchia, another executive assistant to Trump.?*"

With no response forthcoming, Foresman twice sent reminders to Graff--first on April 26 and again on April 30, 2016.78* Graff sent an apology to Foresman and forwardedhis April 26 email (as well as his initial March 2016 email) to Lewandowski2* On May 2, 2016, Graff forwarded Foresman's April 30 email--which suggested an alternative meeting with Donald Trump Jr. or Eric Trump so that Foresman could convey to them information that "should be conveyed to [the candidate] personally or [to] someone [the candidate] absolutely trusts'--to policy advisor Stephen Miller.*°°
No communications or other evidence obtained by the Office indicate that the Trump Campaignlearned that Foresman wasreachingout to invite the candidate to the Forum orthat the Campaign otherwise followed up with Foresman until after the election, when he interacted with the Transition Team as he pursued a possible position in the incoming Administration.°! When interviewed by the Office, Foresman denied that the specific "approach" from "senior Kremlin officials" noted in his March 31, 2016 email was anything other than Kobyakov's invitation to Roscongress. According to Foresman, the "concrete things"he referenced in the same email were a combination of the invitation itself, Foresman's personal perspectives on the invitation and Russia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest Institute). Foresman told the Office that Kobyakov had extendedsimilar invitations through him to another Republican presidential candidate and one other politician. Foresman also said that Kobyakov had asked Foresman to invite Trump to speak after that other presidential candidate withdrew from the race and the otherpolitician's participation did not work out." Finally, Foresman claimed to have no plansto establish a back channel involving Trump, stating the reference to his involvementin the Bush-Putin back channel was meant to burnishhis credentials to the Campaign. Foresman commentedthat he had not recognizedany of the experts announced as Trump's foreign policy team in March 2016, and wanted to secure an in-person meeting with the candidate to share his professional background andpolicy views, including that Trump should decline Kobyakov's invitation to speak at the Forum?"

2016 to early October 2016.3 In late April 2016, Papadopoulos was told by London-based professor Joseph Mifsud, immediately after Mifsud's return from a trip to Moscow, that the Russian government had obtained "dirt" on candidate Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. One week later, on May 6, 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign governmentthat the Trump Campaign had receivedindications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymousrelease of information that would be damaging to candidate Clinton.
Papadopoulos shared information about Russian "dirt" with people outside of the Campaign, and the Office investigated whether he also provided it to a Campaign official. Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials with whom heinteracted told the Office that they did notrecall that Papadopoulos passed them the information. Throughoutthe relevantperiod oftime and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. That meeting never
cameto pass.

Although Carson remained in the presidential race until early March 2016, Papadopoulos had stopped actively working for his campaign by early February 2016.°°° At that time, Papadopoulos reached out to a contact at the London Centre of International Law Practice (LCILP), which billed itself as a "unique institution . . . comprising high-level professional international law practitioners, dedicated to the advancement of global legal knowledge and the practice of international law."°?

Ashe wastakinghis position at LCILP, Papadopoulos contacted Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski via LinkedIn and emailed campaign official Michael Glassner about his interest in joining the Trump Campaign." On March 2, 2016, Papadopoulos sent Glassner another messagereiteratinghis interest.4°? Glassner passed along word of Papadopoulos's interest to another campaignofficial, Joy Lutes, who notified Papadopoulos by email that she had been told by Glassnerto introduce Papadopoulos to Sam Clovis, the Trump Campaign's national cochair and chief policy advisor.
At the time of Papadopoulos's March 2 email, the media was criticizing the Trump Campaignfor lack of experienced foreign policy or national security advisors within its ranks.`°° To addressthat issue, senior Campaign officials asked Clovis to put a foreign policy team together on short notice." After receiving Papadopoulos's name from Lutes, Clovis performed a Google search on Papadopoulos, learned that he had worked at the HudsonInstitute, and believed that he had credibility on energy issues.°'7 On March 3, 2016, Clovis arranged to speak with Papadopoulosby phone to discuss Papadopoulos joining the Campaign as a foreign policy advisor, and on March6, 2016, the two spoke.*°8 Papadopoulos recalled that Russia was mentioned as a topic, and he understood from the conversation that Russia would be an important aspect of the Campaign's foreign policy.'

Papadopoulos's message cameat a time when Clovis perceived a shift in the Campaign's approach
Clovis's response to Papadopoulos, however, did not reflect that shift. Replying to Papadopoulos and the other members of the foreign policy advisory team copied ontheinitial email, Clovis wrote:
This is most informative. Let me work it through the campaign. No commitmentsuntil we see how this plays out. My thought is that we probably should not go forward with any meetings with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATOallies, especially France, Germany and Great Britain. We need to reassure our allies that we are not going to advance anything with Russia until we have everyone on the same page. Morethoughts later today. Great work.'?!

To the contrary, Papadopoulostold the Office that he understood the Campaign to be supportive of his efforts to arrange such a meeting."4! Accordingly, when he returned to London, Papadopoulos resumed those efforts."
Throughout April 2016, Papadopoulos continued to correspond with, meet with, and seek Russia contacts through Mifsud and,at times, Polonskaya."4? For example, within a week of her initial March 24 meeting with him, Polonskaya attempted to send Papadopoulos a text message-- which email exchanges show to have been drafted or edited by Mifsud--addressing Papadopoulos's "wish to engage with the Russian Federation.""** When Papadopouloslearned from Mifsud that Polonskaya had tried to message him, he sent her an email seeking another meeting." Polonskaya responded the next day that she was "back in St. Petersburg" but "would be very pleased to support [Papadopoulos's] initiatives between our two countries" and "to meet [him] again.'"#° Papadopoulosstatedin reply that he thought"a good step" would beto introduce him to "the Russian Ambassadorin London," and that he wouldlike to talk to the ambassador, "or anyoneelse you recommend,about a potential foreign policy trip to Russia."
Mifsud, who had been copied on the email exchanges, replied on the morning of April 11, 2016. He wrote, "This is already been agreed. I am flying to Moscow onthe 18th for a Valdai meeting, plus other meetings at the Duma. Wewill talk tomorrow." The two bodies referenced by Mifsud arepart of or associated with the Russian government: the Dumais a Russianlegislative assembly," while "Valdai"refers to the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow-based group that"is close to Russia's foreign-policy establishment.'"5° Papadopoulos thanked Mifsudandsaid that he would see him "tomorrow."">! For her part, Polonskaya responded that she had "already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request," that "we are all very excited the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,"and that "[t]he Russian Federation would love to welcome him oncehis candidature would be officially announced.'4

Following the meeting, Mifsud traveled as planned to Moscow.**> On April 18, 2016, while in Russia, Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos over email to Ivan Timofeev, a memberofthe Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC).*°° Mifsud had described Timofeev as having connections with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA),**" the executive entity in Russia responsible for Russian foreign relations.*** Over the next several weeks, Papadopoulos and Timofeev had multiple conversations over Skype and email about setting "the groundwork" for a "potential" meeting between the Campaign and Russian governmentofficials"?

e. Russia-Related Communications With The Campaign While he wasdiscussing with his foreign contacts a potential meeting of campaignofficials with Russian governmentofficials, Papadopoulos kept campaign officials apprised of his efforts. On April 25, 2016, the day before Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the emails, Papadopoulos wrote to senior policy advisor Stephen Miller that "[t]he Russian governmenthas an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him whenheis ready," and that "[t]he advantage of being in London is that these governmentstend to speaka bit more openly in `neutral' cities. »466 On April 27, 2016, after his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos wrote a second messageto Miller stating that "some interesting messages [were] coming in from Moscow abouta trip whenthe timeis right.467 The same day, Papadopoulossent a similar email to campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, telling Lewandowskithat Papadopoulos had "been receiving a lot of calls over the last month about Putin wanting to host [Trump] and the team whenthetimeis right.468

On June 1, 2016, Papadopoulosreplied to an earlier email chain with Lewandowski about a Russia visit, asking if Lewandowski "want[ed] to have a call about this topic" and whether "we were following up with it.47? After Lewandowski told Papadopoulos to "connect with" Clovis becausehe was "running point," Papadopoulos emailed Clovis that "the Russian MFA"wasasking him "if Mr. Trumpis interested in visiting Russia at some point." Papadopoulos wrote in an email that he "[w]anted to pass this info along to you for you to decide what's best to do with it and what message I should send(orto ignore).'4"5

Papadopoulos was dismissed from the Trump Campaign in early October 2016, after an interview he gave to the Russian news agency Interfax generated adverse publicity."
ji Trump Campaign Knowledge of "Dirt" Papadopoulos admitted telling at least one individual outside of the Campaign-- specifically, the then-Greek foreign minister--about Russia's obtaining Clinton-related emails,4"3 In addition, a different foreign government informed the FBI that, 10 days after meeting with Mifsud in late April 2016, Papadopoulos suggested that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian governmentthatit could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damagingto Hillary Clinton.4 (This conversation occurred after the GRU spearphished Clinton Campaign chairman John Podesta andstole his emails, and the GRU hacked into the DCCC and DNC, see VolumeI, Sections III.A & TI.B, supra.) Such disclosures raised questions about whether Papadopoulosinformed any Trump Campaignofficial aboutthe emails. Wheninterviewed, Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials who interacted with him told the Office that they could not recall Papadopoulos's sharing the information that Russia had obtained "dirt" on candidate Clinton in the form of emails or that Russia couldassist the Campaign through the anonymousrelease of information about Clinton. Papadopoulos stated that he could notclearly recall having told anyone on the Campaign and wavered about whether he accurately remembered an incident in which Clovis had been upsetafter hearing Papadopoulostell Clovis
that Papadopoulos thought"they have her emails.""?° The Campaignofficials who interacted or corresponded with Papadopoulos havesimilarly stated, with varying degreesof certainty, that he did not tell them. Senior policy advisor Stephen Miller, for example, did not remember hearing anything from Papadopoulos or Clovis about Russia having emails of or dirt on candidate Clinton.*%° Clovis stated that he did not recall anyone, including Papadopoulos, having given him non-public information that a foreign government might be in possession of material damaging to
Clinton.4%7

No documentary evidence, and nothingin the email accountsor other communications facilities reviewed by the Office, shows that Papadopoulos shared this information with the Campaign.
g. Additional George Papadopoulos Contact The Office investigated another Russia-related contact with Papadopoulos. The Office was not fully able to explore the contact because the individual at issue--Sergei Millian--remained out of the country since the inception of our investigation and declined to meet with members of the Office despite our repeated efforts to obtain an interview. Papadopoulosfirst connected with Millian via LinkedIn on July 15, 2016, shortly after Papadopouloshadattended the TAG Summit with Clovis.*? Millian, an American citizen who is anative of Belarus, introduced himself "as president of [the] New York-based Russian American Chamber of Commerce," and claimed that through that position he had "insider knowledge and direct access to the top hierarchy in Russian politics."°! Papadopoulos asked Timofeev whether he had heard of Millian.*°? Although Timofeevsaid no,*° Papadopoulosmet Millian in New York City.°* The meetings took place on July 30 and August 1, 2016.°° Afterwards, Millian invited Papadopoulos to attend--and potentially speak at--two international energy conferences, including one that wasto be held in Moscow in September 2016.°% Papadopoulosultimately did not attend either conference. On July 31, 2016, following his first in-person meeting with Millian, Papadopoulos emailed Trump Campaign official Bo Denysyk to say that he had been contacted "by some leaders of Russian-Americanvoters here in the US about their interest in voting for Mr. Trump," and to ask whether he should "put you in touch with their group (US-Russia chamber of commerce)."°°" Denysyk thanked Papadopoulos "for taking the initiative," but asked him to "hold off with

During his time with the Campaign, Page advocated pro-Russia foreign policy positions and traveled to Moscow in his personalcapacity. Russian intelligence officials had formedrelationships with Page in 2008 and 2013 and Russianofficials may have focused on Page in 2016 becauseofhis affiliation with the Campaign. However, the investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian governmentin its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

In communications with Campaign officials, Page also repeatedly touted his high-level contacts in Russia and his ability to forge connections between candidate Trump and senior Russian governmentalofficials. For example, on January 30, 2016, Page sent an email to senior Campaignofficials stating that he had "spentthe past week in Europe andha[d] been in discussions with some individuals with close ties to the Kremlin" who recognized that Trump could have a "game-changing effect . . . in bringing the end of the new Cold War."5?_ The email stated that "{t]hrough [his] discussions with these high level contacts," Page believed that "a direct meeting
in Moscow between Mr[.] Trump and Putin could be arranged."5"3 Page closed the email b criticizing U.S. sanctions on Russia.5"4
On March 21, 2016, candidate Trump formally and publicly identified Page as a member of his foreign policy team to advise on Russia and the energy sector." Over the next several months, Page continued providing policy-related work product to Campaign officials. For example, in April 2016, Page provided feedback on an outline for a foreign policy speechthat the candidate gave at the Mayflower Hotel,>"" see VolumeI, Section IV.A.4,infra. In May 2016, Page prepared anoutline of an energy policy speech for the Campaign and then traveled to Bismarck, North Dakota, to watch the candidate deliver the speech."* Chief policy advisor Sam Clovis expressed appreciation for Page's work and praised his work to other Campaign officials."

The NES commencement ceremony generally featured high-profile speakers; for example, President Barack Obama delivered a commencement addressat the school in 2009.**! NESofficials told the Office that the interest in inviting Page to speak at NES wasbased entirely on his status as a Trump Campaign advisor who served as the candidate's Russia expert.°°? Andrej Krickovic, an associate of Page's and assistant professor at the Higher School of Economics in Russia, recommended that NES rector Shlomo Weberinvite Page to give the commencementaddress based on his connection to the Trump Campaign.> Denis Klimentov, an employee of NES, said that when Russians learned of Page's involvementin the Trump Campaign in March 2016, the excitement was palpable.*** Weberrecalled that in summer 2016 there was substantial interest in the Trump Campaign in Moscow,andhefelt that bringing a memberof the Campaign to the school would be beneficial.°*
Page was eager to accept the invitation to speak at NES, and he sought approval from Trump Campaignofficials to makethetrip to Russia.°°° On May 16, 2016, while that request was still under consideration, Page emailed Clovis, J.D.

Following the Convention, Page's trip to Moscow andhis advocacy for pro-Russia foreign policy drew the media's attention and beganto generate substantial press coverage. The Campaign respondedby distancing itself from Page, describing him as an "informal foreign policy advisor" who did "not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign."5*" On September 23, 2016, Yahoo!

4. Dimitri Simes and the Centerfor the National Interest
Membersof the Trump Campaign interacted on several occasions with the Center for the National Interest (CNJ), principally through its President and Chief Executive Officer, Dimitri Simes. CNIis a think tank with expertise in and connections to the Russian government. Simes was born in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States in the 1970s. In April 2016, candidate Trumpdeliveredhisfirst speech on foreign policy and national security at an event hosted by the NationalInterest, a publication affiliated with CNI. Then-Senator Jeff Sessions and Russian AmbassadorKislyak both attended the eventand,as a result, it gained someattention in relation to Sessions's confirmation hearings to become Attorney General. Sessions had various other contacts with CNI during the campaign period on foreign-policy matters, including Russia. Jared Kushner also interacted with Simes about Russian issues during the campaign. The investigation did not identify evidence that the Campaign passed or received any messagesto or from the Russian government through CNIor Simes.
a. CNI and Dimitri Simes Connect with the Trump Campaign CNI is a Washington-based non-profit organization that grew outof a center founded by former President Richard Nixon.5®?

Peace.°*? Simes personally has many contacts with current and former Russian government officials,°°8 as does CNI collectively. As CNI stated when seeking a grant from the Carnegie Corporation in 2015, CNI has "unparalleled access to Russian officials and politicians among Washington think tanks,"°" in part because CNI has arranged for U.S. delegations to visit Russia and for Russian delegations to visit the United States as part of so-called "Track II" diplomatic `efforts.°°
On March 14, 2016, CNI board memberRichard Plepler organized a luncheon for CNI and its honorary chairman, Henry Kissinger, at the Time Warner Building in New York.®! The idea behind the event wasto generateinterest in CNI's work and recruit new board members for CNI.°? Along with Simes, attendees at the event included Jared Kushner, son-in-law of candidate Trump.© Kushner told the Office that the event cameat a time when the Trump Campaign was havingtrouble securing support from experiencedforeign policy professionals andthat, as a result,
he decided to seek Simes's assistance during the March 14 event.
Simes and Kushner spoke again on a March 24, 2016 telephonecall,three days after Trumphad publicly namedthe team of foreign policy advisors that had been put together on short notice.On March 31, 2016, Simes and Kushner had an in-person, one-on-one meeting in Kushner's New York office." During that meeting, Simes told Kushner that the best way to handle foreign-policy issues for the Trump Campaign wouldbe to organize an advisory group of experts to meet with candidate Trump and develop a foreign policy approach that was consistent with Trump's voice.Simes believed that Kushner wasreceptive to that suggestion.°"
Simes also had contact with other individuals associated with the Trump Campaign regarding the Campaign's foreign policy positions. For example, on June 17, 2016, Simes sent J.D. Gordon an email with a "memoto Senator Sessionsthat we discussed at our recent meeting"

b. National Interest Hosts a Foreign Policy Speech at the Mayflower Hotel
During both their March 24 phonecall and their March 31 in-person meeting, Simes and Kushnerdiscussed the possibility of CNI hosting a foreign policy speech by candidate Trump.°!! Following those conversations, Simes agreed that he and others associated with CNI would provide behind-the-scenes input on the substance of the foreign-policy speech and that CNI officials would coordinate the logistics of the speech with Sessions and his staff, including Sessions's chiefofstaff, Rick Dearborn.°!?
In mid-April 2016, Kushnerput Simesin contact with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller and forwarded to Simesan outline ofthe foreign-policy speech that Miller had prepared.°!? Simes sent back to the Campaign bullet points with ideas for the speech that he had drafted with CNI Executive Director Paul Saunders and board memberRichard Burt." Simes received subsequent draft outlines from Miller, and he and Saunders spoke to Miller by phone about substantive changesto the speech.°'5 It is not clear, however, whether CNIofficials received an actual draft of the speech for comment; while Saunders recalled having received an actualdraft, Simes did not, and the emails that CNI producedto this Office do not contain such a draft.°!°
After board members expressed concern to Simes that CNI's hosting the speech could be perceived as an endorsementof a particular candidate, CNI decided to have its publication, the National Interest, serve as the host and to have the event at the National Press Club.°'? Kushner later requested that the event be moved to the Mayflower Hotel, which was another venue that Simes had mentioned during initial discussions with the Campaign, in order to address concerns about security and capacity.°!®

On April 25, 2016, Saunders booked event roomsat the Mayflowerto host both the speech and a VIP reception that wasto be held beforehand.°!? Saunders understoodthat the reception-- at which invitees would have the chance to meet candidate Trump--would be a small event.°° Saunders decided who would attend by lookingatthe list of CNI's invitees to the speechitself and then choosing a subset for the reception.! CNI's invitees to the reception included Sessions and Kislyak,%? The week before the speech Simes had informed Kislyak that he would be invited to the speech, and that he would have the opportunity to meet Trump.
Whenthe pre-speech reception began on April 27, a receiving line was quickly organized so that attendees could meet Trump.Sessionsfirst stood next to Trumpto introduce him to the members of Congress who were in attendance.After those members had beenintroduced, Simes stood next to Trump and introduced him to the CNI invitees in attendance, including Kislyak.° Simes perceived the introduction to be positive and friendly, but thoughtit clear that Kislyak and Trumphad just met for the first time." Kislyak also met Kushner during the prespeech reception. The two shook handsand chatted for a minute or two, during which Kushner recalled Kislyak saying, "welike what your candidate is saying. . . it's refreshing."°8
Several public reports state that, in addition to speaking to Kushner at the pre-speech reception, Kislyak also met or conversed with Sessions at that time.Sessions stated to investigators, however, that he did not rememberany such conversation.©° Nor did anyoneelse affiliated with CNI or the National Interest specifically recall a conversation or meeting between Sessions and Kislyak at the pre-speech reception.TM! It appears that, if a conversation occurredat the pre-speech reception, it was a brief one conducted in public view, similar to the exchange between Kushnerand Kislyak.

The Office found no evidence that Kislyak conversed with either TrumporSessionsafter the speech, or would have had the opportunity to do so. Simes, for example, did not recall seeing Kislyak at the post-speech luncheon,°*? and the only witness who accounted for Sessions's whereabouts stated that Sessions may have spoken to the press after the event but then departed for Capitol Hill.*? Saunders recalled, based in part on a food-related request he received from a Campaign staff member, that Trump left the hotel a few minutes after the speech to go to the
airport.°*4
c. JeffSessions's Post-Speech Interactions with CNI In the wake of Sessions's confirmation hearings as Attorney General, questions arose about whether Sessions's campaign-period interactions with CNI apart from the Mayflower speech included any additional meetings with Ambassador Kislyak or involved Russian-related matters. With respectto Kislyak contacts, on May 23, 2016, Sessions attended CNI's Distinguished Service Award dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C.°° Sessions attended a pre-dinner reception and was seated at one of two head tables for the event.°° A seating chart prepared by Saundersindicates that Sessions was scheduled to be seated next to Kislyak, who appears to have respondedto the invitation by indicating he would attend the event.°7 Sessions, however, did not rememberseeing, speaking with, orsitting next to Kislyak at the dinner.® Although CNI board memberCharles Boydsaid he may haveseen Kislyak at the dinner,°*? Simes, Saunders, and Jacob Heilbrunn--editorof the National Interest--all had no recollection of seeing Kislyak at the May 23 event.®? Kislyak also does not appear in any of the photos from the event that the Office obtained. In the summer of 2016, CNI organized at least two dinners in Washington, D.C. for Sessions to meet with experienced foreign policy professionals.' The dinners included CNIaffiliated individuals, such as Richard Burt and Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassadorto Afghanistan and Iraq and the person whohadintroduced Trumpbefore the April 27, 2016 foreign-

policy speech.Khalilzad also met with Sessions one-on-one separately from the dinners.°? At the dinners andin the meetings, the participants addressed U.S. relations with Russia, including how U.S. relations with NATO and Europeancountries affected U.S. policy toward Russia.But
the discussions were not exclusively focused on Russia.* Khalilzad, for example, recalled
discussing "nation-building" and violent extremism with Sessions.In addition, Sessions asked Saunders (of CNI) to draft two memorandanotspecific to Russia: one on Hillary Clinton's foreign
policy shortcomings and another on Egypt."
d. Jared Kushner's-Continuing Contacts with Simes
Betweenthe April 2016 speech at the Mayflower Hotel andthe presidential election, Jared Kushnerhad periodic contacts with Simes."8 Those contacts consisted of both in-person meetings and phone conversations, which concerned how to address issues relating to Russia in the Campaign and how to move forward with the advisory group of foreign policy experts that Simes had proposed.Simes recalled that he, not Kushner,initiated all conversations about Russia, and that Kushnernever asked him to set up back-channel conversations with Russians.According to Simes, after the Mayflowerspeech in late April, Simesraised the issue of Russian contacts with Kushner, advised that it was bad optics for the Campaignto develop hidden Russian contacts, and told Kushnerboth that the Campaign should not highlight Russia as an issue and should handle any contacts with Russians with care.°' Kushner generally provided a similar account of his interactions with Simes.5
Amongthe Kushner-Simes meetings was one held on August 17, 2016, at Simes's request, in Kushner's New York office. The meeting was to address foreign policy advice that CNI was providing and how to respond to the Clinton Campaign's Russia-related attacks on candidate

Trump.°? In advance of the meeting, Simes sent Kushner a "Russia Policy Memo"laying out "what Mr. Trump may wantto say about Russia."°4 In a cover email transmitting that memo and a phone call to set up the meeting, Simes mentioned "a well-documented story of highly questionable connections between Bill Clinton" and the Russian government,"parts of [which]" (according to Simes) had even been "discussed with the CIA and the FBI in the late 1990s and shared with the [Independent Counsel] at the end of the Clinton presidency."®° Kushner forwarded the email to senior Trump Campaignofficials Stephen Miller, Paul Manafort, and Rick Gates, with the note "suggestion only."°°° Manafort subsequently forwarded the email to his assistant and scheduled a meeting with Simes.°" (Manafort was on the verge of leaving the Campaign bythe time of the scheduled meeting with Simes, and Simes ended up meeting only with Kushner).
During the August 17 meeting, Simes provided Kushner the Clinton-related information that he had promised.©® Simes told Kushnerthat,
Simes claimed that he had received this information from former CIA and Reagan White House official Fritz Ermarth, who claimed to have learned it from U.S.
intelligence sources, not from Russians.
Simes perceived that Kushner did not find the information to be ofinterest or use to the Campaign because it was, in Simes's words, "old news."©°! When interviewed by the Office, Kushnerstated that he believed that there waslittle chance of something new being revealed about the Clintons given their long career as public figures, and that he never received from Simes information that could be "operationalized" for the Trump Campaign.® Despite Kushner's

5. June 9, 2016 Meeting at Trump Tower OnJune9, 2016,senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Towerwith a Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert Goldstone,at the request ofhis then-client Emin Agalarov,the son of Russianreal-estate developer Aras Agalarov. Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the "Crown prosecutor of Russia . . . offered to provide the Trump Campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia"as "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump." TrumpJr. immediately respondedthat"if it's what you say I loveit," and arranged the meeting through a series of emails and telephonecalls. Trump Jr. invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared Kushnerto attend the meeting, and both attended. Membersof the Campaign discussed the meeting before it occurred, and Michael Cohen recalled that Trump Jr. may have told candidate Trump about an upcoming meeting to receive adverse information about Clinton, without linking the meeting to Russia. According to written answers submitted by President Trump, he has norecollection of learning of the meetingat the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showingthat he was made awareof the meeting--orits Russian connection--beforeit occurred. The Russian attorney who spoke at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had previously workedfor the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that government throughout this period of time. She claimedthat funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Trump Jr. requested evidence to support those claims, but Veselnitskaya did not provide such information. She and her associates then turnedto a critique of the origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and travel sanctions on Russianofficials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on adoptions of Russian children. TrumpJr. suggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump waselected. After the election, Veselnitskaya made additional efforts to follow up on the meeting, but the Trump Transition Team did not engage.

We considered whether one sequenceofevents suggested that candidate Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the June 9 meeting. On June 7, 2016 Trump announcedhis intention to give "a major speech" "probably Monday of next week"--which would have been June 13--about"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons." See, e.g., Phillip Bump, What we know about the Trump Tower meeting, Washington Post (Aug. 7, 2018). Following the June 9 meeting, Trump changedthe subjectof his planned speech to national security. But the Office did not find evidence that the original idea for the speech was connectedto the anticipated June 9 meetingor that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that meeting to produce concrete evidence about Clinton. Other events, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting on June 12, could well have caused the change. The President's written answers to our questionsstate that the speech's focus was altered "[iJn light of" the Pulse nightclub shooting. See Written Responses, supra. As forthe original topic of the June 13 speech, Trumphassaid that"he expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available, negative information about the Clintons," and that the draft of the speech prepared by Campaignstaff "was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer." Written Responses, supra. In a later June 22 speech, Trump did speak extensively aboutallegations that Clinton was corrupt, drawing from the Clinton Cash book.

Veselnitskaya's press interviewsand written statements to Congressdiffer materially from other accounts. In a July 2017 pressinterview, Veselnitskaya claimed that she has no connection to the Russian government and had notreferred to any derogatory information concerning the Clinton Campaign when she met with Trump Campaignofficials." Veselnitskaya's November 2017 written submission to the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that the purpose of the June 9 meeting was not to connect with "the Trump Campaign"but rather to have "a private meeting with Donald Trump Jr--a friend of my good acquaintance's son on the matter of assisting me or my colleagues in informing the Congress members as to the criminal nature of manipulation and interference with the legislative activities of the US Congress.""** In other words, Veselnitskaya claimed her focus was on Congress and not the Campaign. No witness, however, recalled any reference to Congress during the meeting. Veselnitskaya also maintained that she "attended the meeting as a lawyer of Denis Katsyv," the previously mentioned owner of Prevezon Holdings, but she did not"introduce[her]self in this capacity.""?
Ina July 2017 television interview, Trump Jr. stated that while he had no way to gaugethe reliability, credibility, or accuracy of what Goldstone had stated was the purpose ofthe meeting, if "someone has information on our opponent . . . maybethis is something. I should hear them out."° TrumpJr. further stated in September 2017 congressionaltestimony that he thought he should "listen to what Rob and his colleagues had to say."! Depending on what, if any, information was provided, Trump Jr. stated he could then "consult with counsel to make an

The next month, Goldstone commented to Emin Agalarov about the volumeofpublicity the June 9 meeting had generated, stating that his "reputation [was] basically destroyed by this dumb meeting which your father insisted on even though Ike and Metold him would be bad newsand not to do.""® Goldstone added, "I am not able to respond out of courtesy to you and your father. So am painted as some mysterious link to Putin."7
After public reporting on the June 9 meeting began, representatives from the Trump Organizationagain reached out to participants. On July 10, 2017, Futerfas sent Goldstone an email with a proposed statement for Goldstoneto issue, whichread:
Asthe person whoarranged the meeting, I can definitively state that the statements I have read by Donald TrumpJr. are 100% accurate. The meeting was a complete waste of time and Don wasnevertold Ms. Veselnitskaya's nameprior to the meeting. Ms. Veselnitskaya mostly talked about the Magnitsky Act and Russian adoption laws and the meeting lasted 20 to 30 minutes at most. There was never any follow up and nothing ever cameof the meeting.""
the statement drafted by Trump Organization representatives was 68 He proposed a different statement, asserting that he had been
asked "by [his] client in Moscow -- Emin Agalarov -- to facilitate a meeting between a Russian attorney (Natalia Veselnitzkaya [sic]) and Donald Trump Jr. The lawyer had apparently stated that she had someinformation regarding funding to the DNC from Russia, which she believed Mr.
TrumpJr. mightfind interesting.""? Goldstone never released either statement."
Onthe Russian end, there were also communications about what participants should say about the June 9 meeting. Specifically, the organization that hired Samochornov--an antiMagnitsky Act group controlled by Veselnitskaya and the owner of Prevezon--offered to pay $90,000 of Samochornov's legal fees.""! At Veselnitskaya's request, the organization sent Samochornova transcript of a Veselnitskaya press interview, and Samochornov understoodthat the organization would pay his legal fees only if he made statements consistent with
Veselnitskaya's.""* Samochornov declined, telling the Office that he did not want to perjure

VolumeII, Section II.G, infra, discusses interactions between President Trump, Trump Jr., and othersin June and July 2017 regarding the June 9 meeting.
6. Events at the Republican National Convention Trump Campaignofficials met with Russian AmbassadorSergey Kislyak during the week of the Republican National Convention. Theevidenceindicates that those interactions were brief and non-substantive. During platform committee meetings immediately before the Convention, J.D. Gordon, a senior Campaign advisor on policy and national security, diluted a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform expressing support for providing "lethal" assistance to Ukraine in response to Russian aggression. Gordon requested that platform committee personnel revise the proposed amendmentto state that only "appropriate" assistance be provided to Ukraine. The original sponsorofthe "lethal" assistance amendmentstated that Gordon told her (the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate Trump in connection with his request to dilute the language. Gordon denied making that statement to the sponsor, although he acknowledgedit was possible he mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the subject matter. The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the candidate to make that proposal. Gordonsaid that he sought the change because he believed the proposed language wasinconsistent with Trump's position on Ukraine.
a. AmbassadorKislyak's Encounters with Senator Sessions and J.D. Gordon the Week of the RNC
In July 2016, Senator Sessions and Gordon spoke at the Global Partners in Diplomacy event, a conference co-sponsored by the State Department and the Heritage Foundation held in Cleveland, Ohio the same week as the Republican National Convention (RNC or "Convention").' Approximately 80 foreign ambassadorsto the United States, including Kislyak, wereinvited to the conference,"

Gordon shook hands with Kislyak and reiterated that he had meant what he said in the speech about improving U.S.-Russia relations.'"*! Sessions separately spoke with between six and 12 ambassadors, including Kislyak."? Although Sessions stated during interviews with the Office that he had nospecific recollection of what he discussed with Kislyak, he believed that the two spoke for only a few minutes and that they would have exchanged pleasantries and said somethings about U.S.-Russia relations."
Later that evening, Gordon attended a reception as part of the conference." Gordon ran into Kislyak as the two prepared plates of food, and they decidedto sit at the sametable to eat." They werejoinedat that table by the ambassadors from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and by Trump Campaign advisor Carter Page."*° As they ate, Gordon and Kislyak talked for what Gordon estimated to have been three to five minutes, during which Gordon again mentioned that he meant whathe said in his speech about improving U.S.-Russiarelations."°"
b. Change to Republican Party Platform
In preparation for the 2016 Convention, foreign policy advisors to the Trump Campaign, working with the Republican National Committee, reviewed the 2012 Convention's foreign policy platform to identify divergence betweentheearlier platform and candidate Trump's positions."** The Campaign team discussed toning downlanguagefrom the 2012 platform that identified Russia as the country's numberonethreat, given the candidate's belief that there needed to be better U.S. relations with Russia."?

Gordon told the Office that Trump's statements on the campaign trail following the March meeting underscored thosepositions to the point where Gordonfelt obliged to object to the proposed platform change and seekits dilution."

a. Ambassador Kislyak Invites J.D. Gordon to Breakfast at the Ambassador's Residence

On September8, 2016, Sessions met with Kislyak in his Senate office.*?

8. Paul Manafort Paul Manafort served on the Trump Campaign,including a period as campaign chairman, from March to August 2016.8 Manafort had connections to Russia through his prior work for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and later through his work for a pro-Russian regime in Ukraine. Manafort stayed in touch with these contacts during the campaign period through Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort employee who previously ran Manafort's office in Kiev and who the FBI assesses to haveties to Russianintelligence. Manafort instructed Rick Gates, his deputy on the Campaign anda longtime employee,** to provide Kilimnik with updates on the Trump Campaign--including internal polling data, although Manafort claimsnotto recall that specific instruction. Manafort expected Kilimnik to share that information with others in Ukraine and with Deripaska. Gates periodically sent such polling data to Kilimnik during the campaign.

On September 14, 2018, Manafort pleaded guilty in the District of Columbiato (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States (money laundering, tax fraud, FBAR, Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), and FARA false statements), and (2) conspiracy to obstruct justice (witness tampering). Manafort also admitted criminal conduct with which he had been charged in the Eastern District of Virginia, but as to which the jury hung. The conductat issue in both cases involved Manafort's work in Ukraine and the money he earned for that work, as well as crimes after the Ukraine work ended. OnMarch7, 2019, Manafort was sentenced to 47 months of imprisonmentin the Virginia prosecution. On
March 13, the district court in D.C. sentenced Manafort to a total term of 73 months: 60 months on the Count 1 conspiracy (with 30 of those months to run concurrentto the Virginia sentence), and 13 months on the Count 1 conspiracy, to be served consecutive to the other two sentences. The twosentences resulted in a total term of 90 months.
83° As noted in VolumeI, Section III.D.1.b, supra, Gates pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the District of Columbia, including making a false statement to the FBI, pursuant to a plea agreement. He has provided information and in-court testimony that the Office has deemed to be reliable. See also Transcript at 16, United States v. Paul J. Manafort, Jr., 1:17-cr-201 (D.D.C.

Manafort also twice met Kilimnik in the United States during the campaign period and conveyed campaign information. The second meeting took place on August 2, 2016, in New York City. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a message from former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who wasthen living in Russia. The message was about a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort has since acknowledged was a "backdoor" means for Russia to control eastern Ukraine. Several monthslater, after the presidential election, Kilimnik wrote an email to Manafort expressing the view--which Manafort later said he shared--that the plan's success would require U.S. support to succeed: "all that is required to start the process is a very minor `wink' (or slight push) from [Donald Trump]."*4° The email also stated that if Manafort were designated as the U.S. representative and started the process, Yanukovych would ensurehis reception in Russia "at the very top level."
Manafort communicated with Kilimnik about peace plans for Ukraine on at least four occasionsaftertheir first discussion ofthe topic on August 2: December 2016 (the Kilimnik email described above); January 2017; February 2017; and again in the spring of 2018. The Office reviewed numerous Manafort email and text communications, and asked President Trump about the plan in written questions.**! The investigation did not uncover evidence of Manafort's passing along information about Ukrainian peace plansto the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or the Administration. The Office was not, however, able to gain access to all of Manafort's electronic communications(in some instances, messages were sent using encryption applications). And while Manafort denied that he spoke to members of the Trump Campaign or the new Administration about the peaceplan,he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the peace plan and his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was amongthe reasonsthat the district judge found that he breached his cooperation agreement.*

The judge presiding in Manafort's D.C. criminal case found by a preponderanceof the evidence that Manafort intentionally made multiple false statements to the FBI, the Office, and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with Kilimnik (and concerning two other issues), Although the report refers at times to Manafort's statements, it does so only whenthose statements are sufficiently corroborated to be trustworthy, to identify issues on which Manafort's untruthful responses may themselves be of evidentiary value, or to provide Manafort's explanations for certain events, even when we were unable to determine whetherthat explanation was credible.

be "good for business" and potentially a way to be made wholefor work he previously completed in the Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a "disagreement"--areference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happenedto the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have givenit to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort's sharing polling data and Russia's interference in the election, which hadalready been reported by U.S. mediaoutlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian governmentonits election-interference efforts.
a. Paul Manafort's Ties to Russia and Ukraine Manafort's Russian contacts during the campaign andtransition periods stem from his consulting work for Deripaska from approximately 2005 to 2009 and his separate political consulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his company DMPInternational LLC (DMI). Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev during this entire period and continued to communicate with Manafort through at least June 2018. Kilimnik, who speaks and writes Ukrainian and Russian, facilitated many of Manafort's communications with Deripaska and Ukrainian oligarchs.
i. Oleg Deripaska Consulting Work In approximately 2005, Manafort began working for Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who has a global empire involving aluminum and power companies and whois closely aligned with Vladimir Putin.§? A memorandum describing work that Manafort performed for Deripaska in 2005 regardingthe post-Soviet republics referenced the need to brief the Kremlin andthe benefits that the work could conferon"the Putin Government."*"4 Gates described the work Manafort did for Deripaska as"political risk insurance," and explained that Deripaska used Manafort to install friendly political officials in countries where Deripaska had business interests." Manafort's companyearnedtensof millions of dollars from its work for Deripaska and wasloaned millions of dollars by Deripaska as well.§6 In 2007, Deripaska invested through another entity in Pericles Emerging Market Partners LP. ("Pericles"), an investment fund created by Manafort and former Manafort business partner Richard Davis. The Pericles fund was established to pursue investments in Eastern Europe.*"" Deripaska wasthe sole investor."* Gates stated in interviews with the Office that the venture led

Gates stated that, by 2009, Manafort's business relationship with Deripaska had "dried up."*5° According to Gates, various interactions with Deripaska andhis intermediaries over the past few years have involvedtrying to resolve the legal dispute.**! As described below,in 2016, Manafort, Gates, Kilimnik, and others engaged in efforts to revive the Deripaskarelationship and resolvethelitigation.
ii. Political Consulting Work Through Deripaska, Manafort wasintroduced to Rinat Akhmetov, a Ukrainian oligarch whohired Manafort as a political consultant." In 2005, Akhmetov hired Manafort to engage in political work supporting the Party of Regions,*® a political party in Ukraine that was generally understood to align with Russia. Manafort assisted the Party of Regions in regaining power, and its candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, won the presidency in 2010. Manafort became a close and trusted political advisor to Yanukovych during his time as President of Ukraine. Yanukovych served in that role until 2014, when hefled to Russia amidst popular protests.
iii. Konstantin Kilimnik Kilimnik is a Russian national who has lived in both Russia and Ukraine and was a longtime Manafort employee.*°° Kilimnik had direct and close access to Yanukovych and his senior entourage, and he facilitated communications between Manafort andhisclients, including Yanukovych and multiple Ukrainian oligarchs.*°° Kilimnik also maintained a relationship with Deripaska's deputy, Viktor Boyarkin,*°' a Russian national who previously servedin the defense

According to Gates, in March 2016, Manafort traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to meet with Trump. Trump hired him at that time.*"? Manafort agreed to work on the Campaign without pay. Manafort had no meaningful incomeatthis point in time, but resuscitating his domestic political campaign career could be financially beneficial in the future. Gates reported that Manafort intended, if Trump won the Presidency, to remain outside the Administration and monetizehis relationship with the Administration.*"8
ii, Paul Manafort's Campaign-Period Contacts Immediately upon joining the Campaign, Manafort directed Gates to prepare for his review separate memoranda addressed to Deripaska, Akhmetov, Serhiy Lyovochkin, and Boris Kolesnikov,*" the last three being Ukrainian oligarchs who were senior Opposition Bloc officials.*8° The memoranda described Manafort's appointment to the Trump Campaign and indicated his willingness to consult on Ukrainian politics in the future. On March 30, 2016, Gates emailed the memoranda and a press release announcing Manafort's appointmentto Kilimnik for translation and dissemination.**! Manafort later followed up with Kilimnik to ensure his messages had been delivered, emailing on April 11, 2016 to ask whether Kilimnik had shown "our friends" the media coverage of his new role.*® Kilimnik replied, "Absolutely. Every article." Manafort further asked: "How do we use to get whole. Has Ovd [Oleg Vladimirovich Deripaska] operation seen?"

Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send

Kilimnik Campaigninternal polling data and other updatesso that Kilimnik, in turn, could share

it with Ukrainian oligarchs.*8® Gates understood that the information would also be shared with

58° Gates reported to the Office

that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to sendpolling information, but Gates thoughtit

was a way to showcase Manafort's work, and Manafort wanted to open doors to jobs after the

Trump Campaign ended.* Gates said that Manafort's instruction included sending internal

polling data prepared for the Trump Campaignbypollster Tony Fabrizio.*! Fabrizio had worked

with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort. Gates stated that, in

accordance with Manafort's instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp;

Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis.*°? Gates further told the Office that, after

Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and

that the data he sent was morepublicly available information andless internal data.°"?

Gates's account about polling data is consistent with multiple emails that
Kilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts betweenlate July and mid-August of 2016. Those emails referenced "internal polling," described the status of the Trump Campaign and

That plan, Manafort later acknowledged, constituted a "backdoor" means for Russia to control
eastern Ukraine.?"* Manafort initially said that, if he had not cut off the discussion, Kilimnik would have asked Manafort in the August 2 meeting to convince Trump to comeoutin favor of the peace plan, and Yanukovych would have expected Manafort to use his connections in Europe and Ukraine to support the plan."° Manafort alsoinitially told the Office that he had said to Kilimnik
that the plan was crazy, that the discussion ended, and that he did not recall Kilimnik askin
Manafort to reconsider the plan after their August 2 meeting."° Manafort said that he reacted negatively to Yanukovych sending--years later--an "urgent"
request when Yanukovych needed him."?? When confronted with an email written by Kilimnik on or about December 8, 2016, however, Manafort acknowledged Kilimnik raised the peace plan again in that email.°?* Manafort ultimately acknowledged Kilimnik also raised the peace plan in ase and February 2017 meetings with `anor

region as prime minister of the republic, and facilitate the reintegration of the = into Ukraine with the

support of the U.S. and Russian presidents. As noted above, according to

the written

documentation describing the plan, for the plan to work, both U.S. and Russian support were necessary.

Third, according to Gates and whatKilimnik told Patten, Manafort and Kilimnik discussed two sets of financial disputes related to Manafort's previous work in the region. Those consisted of the unresolved Deripaska lawsuit and the fundsthat the Opposition Bloc owed to Manafortfor
his political consulting work and how Manafort might be able to obtain payment." After the meeting, Gates and Manafort both stated that they left separately from Kilimnik
because they knew the media was tracking Manafort and wanted to avoid media reporting on his connectionsto Kilimnik.?*4
c. Post-Resignation Activities Manafort resigned from the Trump Campaign in mid-August 2016, approximately two weeks after his second meeting with Kilimnik, amidst negative media reporting abouthis political consulting work for the pro-Russian Party of Regions in Ukraine. Despite his resignation, Manafort continuedto offer advice to various Campaign officials through the Novemberelection. Manafort told Gates that hestill spoke with Kushner, Bannon, and candidate Trump,' and some of those post-resignation contacts are documented in emails. For example, on October 21, 2016, Manafort sent Kushner an email and attached a strategy memorandum proposing that the Campaign makethecase against Clinton "as the failed and corrupt championofthe establishment" and that "Wikileaks provides the Trump campaign the ability to make the case in a very credible way -- by using the words of Clinton, its campaign officials and DNC members."?*° Later, in a November5, 2016 email to Kushnerentitled "Securing the Victory," Manafort stated that he was "really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preservingthe victory," and that he was concerned the Clinton Campaign would respondto a loss by "mov[ing] immediately to discredit the [Trump] victory and claim voter fraud and cyber-fraud, including the claim that the Russians have hacked into the voting machines and tamperedwith the results."37 Trumpwaselected President on November 8, 2016. Manafort told the Office that, in the wake of Trump's victory, he was not interested in an Administration job. Manafort instead preferred to stay on the "outside," and monetize his campaign position to generate business given his familiarity and relationship with Trump and the incoming Administration.%* Manafort appeared to follow that plan, as he traveled to the Middle East, Cuba, South Korea, Japan, and China andwaspaid to explain what a Trump presidency would entail." Manafort's activities in early 2017 included meetingsrelating to Ukraine and Russia. The

first meeting, which took place in Madrid, Spain in January 2017, was with Georgiy Oganov. Oganov, who had previously worked at the Russian Embassy in the United States, was a senior executive at a Deripaska company and wasbelievedto report directly to Deripaska."° Manafort initially denied attending the meeting. When he later acknowledgedit, he claimedthat the meeting had been arranged by his lawyers and concerned only the Pericles lawsuit."! Other evidence, however, provides reason to doubt Manafort's statementthat the sole topic of the meeting wasthe Pericles lawsuit. In particular, text messages to Manafort from a numberassociated with Kilimnik suggest that Kilimnik and Boyarkin--not Manafort's counsel--had arranged the meeting between Manafort and Oganov.? Kilimnik's message states that the meeting was supposed to be "not about moneyor Pericles"but instead "about recreating [the] old friendship"--ostensibly between Manafort and Deripaska--`andtalking about globalpolitics."°4? Manafort also replied by text that he "need[s] this finished before Jan. 20,"** which appearsto be a reference to resolving Pericles before the inauguration.
On January 15, 2017, three days after his return from Madrid, Manafort emailed K.T. McFarland, who wasat that time designated to be Deputy National Security Advisor and was
formally appointed to that position on January 20, 2017." Manafort's January 15 email to McFarland stated: "I have some important information I want to share that I picked up on my travels over the last month."*° Manafort told the Office that the email referred to an issue regarding Cuba, not Russia or Ukraine, and Manafort had traveled to Cuba in the past month."*" Either way, McFarland--who was advised by Flynn not to respond to the Manafort inquiry-- appears notto have responded to Manafort."
Manafort told the Office that around the time of the Presidential Inauguration in January, he met with Kilimnik and Ukrainian oligarch Serhiy Lyovochkin at the Westin Hotel in Alexandria, Virginia."? During this meeting, Kilimnik again discussed the Yanukovych peace plan that he had broached at the August 2 meeting andin a detailed December 8, 2016 message found in Kilimnik's DMP email account.

Those contacts included matters pertaining to the criminal charges brought by the Office,' and the Ukraine peace plan. In early 2018, Manafort retained his longtimepolling firm to craft a draft poll in Ukraine, sent the pollsters a three-page primer on the plan sent by Kilimnik, and worked with Kilimnik to formulate the polling questions.*°° The primer sentto the pollsters specifically called for the United States and President Trump to support the Autonomous Republic of Donbas with Yanukovych as Prime Minister,"*! and a series of questionsin the draft poll asked for opinions on Yanukovych's role in resolving the conflict in Donbas.° (The poll was not solely about Donbas; it also sought participants' views on leaders apart from Yanukovychas they pertained to the 2019 Ukraine presidential election.)

B. Post-Election and Transition-Period Contacts
Trump waselected President on November 8, 2016. Beginning immediately after the election, individuals connected to the Russian government started contacting officials on the Trump Campaign andTransition Team through multiple channels--sometimes through Russian AmbassadorKislyak andat other times through individuals who soughtreliable contacts through U.S. personsnot formally tied to the Campaign or Transition Team. The mostseniorlevels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The investigation did not establish that these efforts reflected or constituted coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia in its electioninterference activities.
1. Immediate Post-Election Activity
As soon as news broke that Trump had been elected President, Russian government officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new Administration. They appeared not to have preexisting contacts and struggled to connect with seniorofficials around the President-Elect. As explained below,those efforts entailed both official contact through the Russian Embassy in the United States and outreaches--sanctioned at high
levels of the Russian government--throughbusinessrather than political contacts.

a. Outreach from the Russian Government
At approximately 3 a.m. on election night, Trump Campaignpress secretary Hope Hicks received a telephonecall on her personalcell phone from a person who soundedforeign but was calling from a number with a DC area code.Although Hicks had a hard time understandingthe person, she could make out the words "Putin call."°Hicks told the caller to send her an email.?%
The following morning, on November9, 2016, Sergey Kuznetsov, an official at the Russian Embassy to the United States, emailed Hicks from his Gmail address with the subject line, "Message from Putin."**? Attached to the email was a message from Putin, in both English and Russian, which Kuznetsov asked Hicks to conveyto the President-Elect."In the message, Putin offered his congratulations to Trump for his electoral victory, stating he "look[ed] forward to working with [Trump] on leading Russian-Americanrelations out of crisis."°°
Hicks forwarded the email to Kushner, asking, "Can you look into this? Don't want to get
duped but don't want to blow off Putin!"?" Kushner stated in Congressional testimony that he believed that it would be possible to verify the authenticity of the forwarded email through the Russian Ambassador, whom Kushnerhad previously met in April 2016.°"! Unableto recall the
Russian Ambassador's name, Kushner emailed Dimitri Simes of CNI, whom he had consulted previously about Russia, see VolumeI, Section IV.A.4, supra, and asked, "What is the name of Russian ambassador?' Kushner forwarded Simes's response--which identified Kislyak by name--to Hicks." After checking with Kushner to see what he had learned, Hicks conveyed Putin's letter to transition officials.?" Five days later, on November 14, 2016, Trump and Putin spoke by phone in the presence of Transition Team members, including incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.?"

2.

Dmitriev undertookefforts to meet members of the incoming Trump Administration in the monthsafterthe election. Dmitriev asked a close business associate who workedfor the United Arab Emirates (UAE) royal court, George Nader, to introduce him to Trumptransition officials, and Nadereventually arranged a meeting in the Seychelles between Dmitriev and Erik Prince, a Trump Campaign supporter and an associate of Steve Bannon."*In addition, the UAE national security advisor introduced Dmitriev to a hedge fund managerand friend of Jared Kushner, Rick Gerson, in late November 2016. In December 2016 and January 2017, Dmitriev and Gerson worked on a proposal for reconciliation between the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied he cleared through Putin. Gerson provided that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration, and Kushnerlater gave copies to Bannon and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

4, Jared Kushner's Meeting with Sergey Gorkov
On December6, 2016, the Russian Embassy reached out to Kushner's assistant to set up a second meeting between Kislyak and Kushner.'!#° Kushner declined several proposed meeting dates, but Kushner's assistant indicated that Kislyak was very insistent about securing a second meeting.!!"7 Kushnertold the Office that he did not want to take another meeting because he had already decided Kislyak was not the right channel for him to communicate with Russia, so he arranged to haveoneofhisassistants, Avi Berkowitz, meet with Kislyakin his stead.'4* Although embassy official Sergey Kuznetsov wrote to Berkowitz that Kislyak thought it "important" to "continue the conversation with Mr. Kushnerin person,"!!4? Kislyak nonetheless agreed to meet instead with Berkowitz once it became apparent that Kushner wasunlikely to take a meeting.
Berkowitz met with Kislyak on December 12, 2016, at Trump Tower.!'°° The meeting lasted only a few minutes, during which Kislyak indicated that he wanted Kushner to meet someone who had a direct line to Putin: Sergey Gorkov, the head of the Russian-governmentowned bank Vnesheconombank (VEB).
Kushner agreed to meet with Gorkov.!!°! The one-on-one meeting tookplacethe next day, December13, 2016, at the Colony Capital building in Manhattan, where Kushner had previously scheduled meetings.!5?

the meeting and that no one on the Transition Team even did a Google search for
Gorkov's name.!!9> At the start of the meeting, Gorkov presented Kushner with twogifts: a painting and a bag
ofsoil from the town in Belarus where Kushner's family originated.'!°° The accounts from Kushner and Gorkov differ as to whether the meeting was diplomatic
or business in nature. Kushner told the Office that the meeting was diplomatic, with Gorkov expressing disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for improvedrelations with the incoming Administration.''°' According to Kushner, although Gorkov told Kushnera little bit about his bank and made somestatements about the Russian economy,the two did not discuss Kushner's companiesorprivate business dealingsof any kind.''** (Atthe time of the meeting, Kushner Companieshad a debt obligation coming due onthe building it ownedat 666 Fifth Avenue, andthere had beenpublic reporting both about efforts to secure lending on the property and possible conflicts of interest for Kushnerarising out of his company's borrowing from foreign lenders.!'*')
In contrast, in a 2017 public statement, VEB suggested Gorkov met with Kushner in Kushner's capacity as CEO of Kushner Companiesfor the purpose ofdiscussing business, rather than as part of a diplomatic effort. In particular, VEB characterized Gorkov's meeting with Kushneraspart of a series of "roadshow meetings" with "representatives of major US banks and business circles," which included "negotiations" and discussion of the "most promising business lines and sectors,"!!®
Foresman, the investment bank executive mentioned in VolumeI, Sections IV.A.1 and IV.B.3, supra, told the Office that he met with Gorkov and VEB deputy chairman Nikolay Tsekhomsky in Moscow just before Gorkovleft for New York to meet Kushner.''6! Accordingto Foresman, Gorkov and Tsekhomskytold him that they were traveling to New Yorkto discuss postelection issues with U.S. financial institutions, that their trip was sanctioned by Putin, and that they
would be reporting backto Putin upontheir return.!!

The investigation did not resolve the apparent conflict in the accounts of Kushner and Gorkov or determine whether the meeting was diplomatic in nature (as Kushnerstated), focused on business (as VEB's public statement indicated), or whether it involved some combination of those matters or other matters. Regardless, the investigation did notidentify evidence that Kushner and Gorkov engaged in any substantive follow-upafter the meeting.
Rather, a few days after the meeting, Gorkov's assistant texted Kushner's assistant, "Hi, please inform yourside that the information about the meeting had a very positive response!""!'®
Overthe following weeks, the twoassistants exchanged a handful of additional cordial texts.!! On February 8, 2017, Gorkov's assistant texted Kushner's assistant (Berkowitz) to try to set up another meeting, and followed up by text at least twice in the days that followed."!®> According to Berkowitz, he did not respond to the meeting request in light of the press coverage regarding the Russia investigation, and did nottell Kushner about the meeting request.!!%
5. Petr Aven's Outreach Efforts to the Transition Team
In December 2016, weeks after the one-on-one meeting with Putin described in VolumeI, Section IV.B.1.b, supra, Petr Aven attended what he described as a separate "all-hands" oligarch
meeting between Putin and Russia's most prominent businessmen.'!®" As in Aven's one-on-one meeting, a main topic of discussion at the oligarch meeting in December 2016 wasthe prospect of forthcoming U.S. economic sanctions.!!8
After the December 2016 all-hands meeting, Aven tried to establish a connection to the Trump team. Aven instructed Richard Burt to make contact with the incoming Trump Administration. Burt was on the boardof directors for LetterOne (L1), another company headed
by Aven, and had done work for Alfa-Bank.'! Burt had previously served as U.S. ambassador to Germany and Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, and one ofhis primary roles with Alfa-Bank and L1 wasto facilitate introductions to business contacts in the United States and other Western countries.!!"°
While at a L1 board meeting held in Luxembourgin late December 2016, Aven pulled Burt aside and told him that he had spoken to someonehigh in the Russian government who expressed

interest in establishing a communications channel between the Kremlin and the Trump Transition Team.!!7! Avenasked for Burt's help in contacting membersofthe Transition Team.!!? Although Burt had been responsible for helping Aven build connections in the past, Burt viewed Aven's request as unusualand outside the normal realm of his dealings with Aven.!!3
Burt, who is a member of the board of CNI (discussed at VolumeI, Section IV.A.4, supra),!'TM decided to approach CNIpresident Dimitri Simes for help facilitating Aven's request,
recalling that Simes had somerelationship with Kushner.!'> Atthe time, Simes was lobbying the TrumpTransition Team, on Burt's behalf, to appoint Burt U.S. ambassadorto Russia.'!"°
Burt contacted Simes by telephone and askedif he could arrange a meeting with Kushner to discuss setting up a high-level communications channel between Putin and the incoming Administration.'!7" Simestold the Office that he declined and stated to Burt that setting up such a channel wasnot a goodideain light of the media attention surrounding Russian influencein the U.S. presidential election.!!8 According to Simes, he understood that Burt was seeking a secret channel, and Simes did not want CNI to be seen as an intermediary between the Russian governmentand the incoming Administration.!!" Based on what Simeshad read in the media, he stated that he already had concerns that Trump's business connections could be exploited by Russia, and Simessaid that he did not want CNI to have any involvementor apparent involvement in facilitating any connection.!!®°
In an email dated December 22, 2016, Burt recounted for Aven his conversation with Simes:
Througha trusted third party, I have reached outto the very influential person I mentioned in Luxembourg concerning Project A. There is an interest and an understanding for the needto establish such a channel. Butthe individual emphasized that at this moment, with so much intense interest in the Congress and the media over the question of cyber-hacking (and who ordered what), Project A was too explosive to discuss. The individual agreed to discuss it again after the New Year. trust the individual's instincts on this.

If this is unclear or you would like to discuss, don't hesitateto call.11*! According to Burt, the "very influential person" referenced in his email was Simes, and the reference to a "trusted third party" wasa fabrication, as no such third party existed. "Project A" was a term that Burt created for Aven's effort to help establish a communications channel between Russia and the Trump team,which he usedin light of the sensitivities surrounding what Aven was requesting, especially in light of the recent attention to Russia's influence in the U.S. presidential election.!!8? According to Burt, his report that there was "interest" in a communications channel reflected Simes's views, not necessarily those of the Transition Team, and in any event, Burt acknowledged that he added some "hype"to that sentence to makeit sound like there was more interest from the Transition Team than mayhaveactually existed.''®
Avenreplied to Burt's email on the same day, saying "Thank you. All clear."!/*4 According to Aven,this statementindicated that he did not wantthe outreach to continue.'!®> Burt spoke to Aven sometime thereafter about his attempt to make contact with the Trump team,
explaining to Aven that the current environment made it impossible, aT
186 Burt did not recall discussing Aven's request with Simes again, nor did he recall speaking to anyoneelse about the request.!'87
In thefirst quarter of 2017, Aven met again with Putin and other Russian officials.!'®* At
waco kt ss aaa that meeting, Putin asked about Aven's attempt to build relations with the Trum| Administration, 1199 Putin continued to inquire about Aven's efforts to connect to the Trump Administration in several subsequentquarterly meetings.!!*!

Flynn Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn wasthe Transition Team's primary conduit for communications with the Russian Ambassadorand dealt with Russia on two sensitive matters during the transition period: a United Nations Security Council vote and the Russian government's reaction to the United States's imposition of sanctions for Russian interference in
the 2016 election.'2°7 Despite Kushner's conclusion that Kislyak did not wield influence inside the Russian government, the Transition Team turned to Flynn's relationship with Kislyak on both issues. As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland, his incoming deputy, to prepare for his call to Kislyak; McFarland was with the President-Elect and other senior membersof the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lagoat the time. Althoughtransition officials at Mara-Lago had someconcern about possible Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did
not identify evidencethat the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak. Flynn asked Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to U.S. sanctions imposed on December29, 2016, and Kislyaklater reported to Flynn that Russia accededto that request.

In sum,the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaignofficials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In someinstances, the Campaign wasreceptiveto the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian governmentin its election-interference activities.

V. PROSECUTION AND DECLINATION DECISIONS The Appointment Order authorized the Special Counsel's Office "to prosecute federal
crimes arising from [its] investigation" of the matters assigned to it. In deciding whether to exercise this prosecutorial authority, the Office has been guided by the Principles of Federal Prosecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney's) Manual. In particular, the Office has evaluated whether the conduct of the individuals considered for prosecution constituted a federal offense and whether admissible evidence would probablybe sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction for such an offense. Justice Manual § 9-27.220 (2018). Where the answer to those questionswasyes, the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction, and there existed an adequate non-criminalalternative to prosecution. Id.
As explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets of Russian nationals for their roles in perpetrating the active-measures social media campaign and computer-intrusion operations. EWMmmreMenerie MET
The Office similarly determined that the contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals either did not involve the commission of a federal crime or, in the case of campaign-finance offenses, that our evidence wasnotsufficient to obtain and sustain a criminal conviction. At the same time, the Office concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution supported charging certain individuals connected to the Campaign with making false statements or otherwise obstructing this investigation or parallel congressional investigations.
A. Russian "Active Measures" Social Media Campaign On February 16, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment charging 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities--including the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and Concord Management and Consulting LLC (Concord)--with
violating U.S. criminal lawsin orderto interfere with U.S. elections andpolitical processes.'?"° The indictment chargesall of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One), three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud (Count Two), and five defendants with aggravated identity theft (Counts Three through Eight). Internet Research Agency Indictment. Concord, whichis one of the entities charged in the Count Oneconspiracy, entered an appearancethrough U.S. counsel and movedto dismiss the charge on multiple grounds. In orders and memorandum opinions issued on August 13 and November 15, 2018, the district court denied Concord's motions to dismiss. United States v. Concord Management & Consulting LLC, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38 (D.D.C. 2018). United States v. Concord Management & Consulting
LLC, 317 F. Supp. 3d 598 (D.D.C. 2018). As of this writing, the prosecution of Concord remains ongoing before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The other defendants remain at large.
276 A more detailed explanation of the charging decision in this case is set forth in a separate memorandum provided to the Acting Attorney General before the indictment.

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WorkPreduet // PrMay-Conti oMateriltect Fed Re -Crim-P-6fd e}
Although members of the IRA had contact with individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaignofficial or any other U.S. person with participating in the conspiracy. That is because the investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated with the IRA knew that he or she was speaking with Russian nationals engaged in the criminal conspiracy. The Office therefore determined that such persons did not have the knowledgeor criminal purpose required to charge them in the conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One)or in the separate countalleging
a wire- and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA andtwo individual Russian nationals (Count Two).
The Office did, however, charge one U.S. nationalfor his role in supplying false or stolen bank account numbersthat allowed the IRA conspirators to access U.S. online payment systems by circumventing those systems' security features. On February 12, 2018, Richard Pinedo pleaded guilty, pursuant to a single-count information, to identity fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(7) and (b)(1)(D). Plea Agreement, United States v. Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2018), Doc. 10. The investigation did not establish that Pinedo was aware of the identity of the IRA members who purchased bank account numbers from him. Pinedo's sales of account numbers enabled the IRA members to anonymouslyaccess a financial network through which they transacted with U.S. persons and companies. See Gov't Sent. Mem.at 3, United States y. Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24 (D.D.C. Sept. 26, 2018), Doc. 24. On October 10, 2018, Pinedo wassentencedto six months of imprisonment,to be followed by six months of home confinement, and was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service.
B. Russian Hacking and Dumping Operations 1. Section 1030 Computer-Intrusion Conspiracy a. Background
On July 13, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbiareturned an indictment charging Russian military intelligence officers from the GRU with conspiring to hack into various U.S. computers used by the Clinton Campaign, DNC, DCCC,and other U.S. persons,in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030 and 371 (Count One); committing identity theft and conspiring to commit money laundering in furtherance of that hacking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028A and 1956(h) (Counts Two through Ten); and a separate conspiracy to hack into the computers of U.S. persons andentities responsible for the administration of the 2016 U.S. election,in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030 and 371 (Count Eleven). Netyksho Indictment." Asofthis writing,all 12 defendants remain at large.
The Netyksho indictment alleges that the defendants conspired with one another and with others to hackinto the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere in the election.

278 The Office also considered, but ruled out, charges on the theory that the post-hacking sharing and dissemination of emails could constitute trafficking in or receipt of stolen property under the National Stolen Property Act (NSPA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314 and 2315. The statutes comprising the NSPA cover "goods, wares, or merchandise," and lower courts have largely understood that phrase to be limited to tangible items since the Supreme Court's decision in Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985). See United States v. Yijia Zhang, 995 F, Supp. 2d 340, 344-48 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (collecting cases). One of those post-Dowling decisions--United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301 (10th Cir. 1991)--specifically held that the NSPA doesnot reach "a computer program in source code form," even though that code was stored in tangible items (7.e., a hard disk and in a three-ring notebook). Jd. at 1302-03. Congress, in turn, cited the Brown opinion in explaining the need for amendments to 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2) that "would ensure that the theft of intangible information by the unauthorized use of a computeris prohibited in the same way theft of physical items [is] protected." S. Rep. 104-357, at 7 (1996). That sequence of events would makeit
difficult to argue that hacked emails in electronic form, which are the relevant stolen items here, constitute "goods, wares, or merchandise" within the meaning of the NSPA.

2. Potential Section 1030 Violation >,

See United States v.

Willis, 476 F.3d 1121, 1125 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007) (explaining that the 1986 amendmentsto Section

1030 reflect Congress's desire to reach "`iintentional acts of unauthorized access--rather than

mistaken, inadvertent, or careless ones'") (quoting S. Rep. 99-432,at 5 (1986)). In addition, the

computer

likely qualifies as a "protected" one underthe statute, which

reaches "effectively all computers with Internet access." United States v. Nosal, 676 F.3d 854,

859 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc).

Applying the Principles of Federal Prosecution, however, the Office determined that prosecutionof this potential violation was not warranted. Those Principlesinstruct prosecutors to consider, amongotherthings, the nature and seriousnessof the offense, the person's culpability in connection with the offense, and the probable sentence to be imposed if the prosecution is successful. Justice Manual 9-27.230.

C. Russian Government Outreach and Contacts As explained in Section IV above, the Office's investigation uncovered evidence of numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts underseveral sets of federal laws, including conspiracy lawsandstatutes governing foreign agents who operate in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above--with the exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based ontheir activities on behalf of Ukraine. Oneofthe interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals-- the June 9, 2016 meeting between high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising derogatory information on Hillary Clinton--implicates an additional body of law: campaignfinance statutes. Schemesinvolving thesolicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As explained below, the Office evaluated those questions in connection with the June 9 MMR Matter The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principallegal questions were resolved fayorably to the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaignofficials or individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law. Finally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russiaaffiliated individuals may not havebeensufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several U.S. persons connectedto the Campaign madefalse statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct the Office's investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore charged someofthose individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice.
1. Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion Asaninitial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of "collusion," but through the lens of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word "collud[e]" appears in the Acting Attorney General's August 2, 2017 memorandum;it has frequently been invoked in public reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusionis not a specific offense or theory ofliability found in the U.S. Code; noris it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the contrary, even as definedin legaldictionaries, collusion is largely synonymouswith conspiracy as that crimeis set forth in the general federal conspiracystatute, 18 U.S.C. § 371. See Black's Law Dictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is "[a]n agreement to defraud anotherorto do or obtain something forbidden by law"); 1 Alexander Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871) ("An agreement between two or more personsto defraud another by the formsoflaw, or to employ such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object."); 1 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 352
180

U.S. Departmentof Justice Werk // ProMay-Conti teMaterileted-CFed nR--Cd rim e P-6fe} r
(1897) ("An agreement between two or more personsto defraud a person ofhis rights by the forms oflaw,or to obtain an object forbidden by law.").
For that reason, this Office's focus in resolving the question ofjoint criminalliability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term "collusion." The Office considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals couldtriggerliability for the crime of conspiracy--either understatutes that havetheir own conspiracy language (e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 1349, 1951(a)), or under the general conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. § 371). The investigation did notestablish that the contacts described in Volume I, Section IV, supra, amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal law--including foreign-influence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are discussed further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the Trump Campaignwith conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either undera specific statute or under Section 371's offenses clause.
The Office also did not charge any campaignofficial or associate with a conspiracy under Section 371's defraud clause. That clause criminalizes participating in an agreementto obstruct a lawful function of the U.S. governmentorits agencies through deceitful or dishonest means. See Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 861 (1966); Hammerschmidt v. United States, 2605 U.S. 182, 188 (1924); see also United States v. Concord Mgmt. & Consulting LLC, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38, 46 (D.D.C. 2018). The investigation did not establish any agreement among Campaign officials-- or between such officials and Russia-linked individuals--to interfere with or obstruct a lawful function of a government agency during the campaignor transition period. And, as discussed in VolumeI, Section V.A, supra, the investigation did not identify evidence that any Campaign official or associate knowingly andintentionally participated in the conspiracy to defraud that the Office charged, namely, the active-measures conspiracy described in VolumeI, Section II, supra. Accordingly, the Office did not charge any Campaign associate or other U.S. person with conspiracy to defraud the United States based on the Russia-related contacts described in Section IV above.
2. Potential Coordination: Foreign Agent Statutes (FARA and 18 U.S.C. § 951) The Office next assessed the potential liability of Campaign-affiliated individuals under federal statutes regulating actions on behalf of, or work donefor, a foreign government.
a. Governing Law Under 18 U.S.C. § 951, it is generally illegal to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without providing notice to the Attorney General. Although the defendant mustact on behalf of a foreign government (as opposedto other kinds of foreign entities), the acts need not involve espionage; rather, acts of any type suffice for liability. See United States v. Duran, 596 F.3d 1283, 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2010); United States v. Latchin, 554 F.3d 709, 715 (7th Cir. 2009); United States v. Dumeisi, 424 F.3d 566, 581 (7th Cir. 2005). An "agent of a foreign government" is an "individual" who "agrees to operate" in the United States "subject to the direction or control of a foreign governmentorofficial." 18 U.S.C. § 951(d).
181

U.S. Departmentof Justice Atterney-WorkPreduet // PrMay-Conti oMateriltect Fed R-e Crimt P6d 0}
Thecrime defined by Section 951 is complete upon knowingly acting in the United States as an unregistered foreign-government agent. 18 U.S.C. § 951(a). The statute does not require willfulness, and knowledgeofthe notification requirementis not an element ofthe offense. United States v. Campa, 529 F.3d 980, 998-99 (11th Cir. 2008); Duran, 596 F.3d at 1291-94; Dumeisi, 424 F.3d at 581.
The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) generally makesit illegal to act as an agent of a foreign principal by engaging in certain (largely political) activities in the United States without registering with the Attorney General. 22 U.S.C. §§ 611-621. The triggering agency relationship must be with a foreign principal or "a person any of whoseactivities are directly or indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a foreign principal." 22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(1). That includes a foreign governmentorpolitical party and various foreign individuals and entities. 22 U.S.C. § 611(b). A covered relationship exists if a person "acts as an agent, representative, employee, or servant"or "in any other capacity at the order, request, or underthe [foreign principal's] direction or control." 22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(1). It is sufficient if the person "agrees, consents, assumes or purports to act as, or who is or holds himself out to be, whether or not pursuant to contractual relationship, an agent of a foreign principal." 22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(2).
Thetriggering activity is that the agent "directly or through any other person"in the United States (1) engagesin "political activities for or in the interests of [the] foreign principal," which includes attempts to influence federal officials or the public; (2) acts as "public relations counsel, publicity agent, information-service employeeorpolitical consultantfor or in the interests of such foreign principal"; (3) "solicits, collects, disburses, or dispenses contributions, loans, money, or otherthingsofvalueforor in the interest of such foreign principal"; or (4) "represents the interests of such foreign principal" before any federal agencyorofficial. 22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(1).
It is a crime to engagein a "[w]illful violation of any provision of the Act or any regulation thereunder." 22 U.S.C. § 618(a)(1). It is also a crime willfully to make false statements or omissions of material facts in FARA registration statements or supplements. 22 U.S.C. § 618(a)(2). Most violations have a maximumpenalty of five years of imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. 22 U.S.C. § 618.
b. Application The investigation uncovered extensive evidence that Paul Manafort's and Richard Gates's pre-campaign work for the government of Ukraine violated FARA. Manafort and Gates were charged for that conduct and admitted to it when they pleaded guilty to superseding criminal informationsin the District of Columbia prosecution.'*®° The evidence underlying those charges is not addressedin this report because it was discussed in public court documents andin a separate 1289 Gates Superseding Criminal Information; Waiver of Indictment, United States v.

prosecution memorandum submitted to the Acting Attorney General before the original indictment in that case.
In addition, the investigation produced evidence of FARA violations involving Michael Flynn. Those potential violations, however, concerned a country other than Russia (Z.e., Turkey) and were resolved when Flynn admitted to the underlying facts in the Statement of Offense that accompanied his guilty plea to a false-statements charge. Statement of Offense, United Statesv. Michael T. Flynn, No. 1:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 4 ("Flynn Statement of Offense"),!28!
The investigation did not, however, yield evidence sufficient to sustain any charge that any individual affiliated with the Trump Campaign acted as an agentofa foreign principal within the meaning of FARA or,in termsof Section 951, subject to the direction or control ofthe government of Russia, or any official thereof. In particular, the Office did not find evidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubtthat Campaignofficials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government--orat its direction, control, or request--during the relevant time period.'2®

Asa result, the Office did not charge

any other Trump Campaignofficial with violating

FARA orSection 951, or attempting or conspiring to do so, based on contacts with the Russian

governmentor a Russian principal.

Finally, the Office investigated whether one of the above campaign advisors--George Papadopoulos--actedas an agentof, or at the direction and controlof, the governmentofIsrael. While the investigation revealed significant ties between Papadopoulos and Israel (and search warrants were obtainedin part on that basis), the Office ultimately determinedthat the evidence wasnot sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction under FARA orSection 951.

3. Campaign Finance

Severalareas of the Office's investigation involvedefforts or offers by foreign nationals to provide negative information about candidate Clinton to the Trump Campaign orto distribute that information to the public, to the anticipated benefit of the Campaign. As explained below, the Office considered whether two ofthose efforts in particular--the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump

1282 On four occasions, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issued warrants based ona finding of probable cause to believe that Page was an agentof a foreign power. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(b), 1805(a)(2)(A). The FISC's probable-cause finding was based on a different (and lower) standard than the one governing the Office's decision whether to bring charges against Page, which is whether admissible evidence would likely be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Page acted as an agent of the Russian Federation during the period at issue. Cf United States v. Cardoza, 713 F.3d 656, 660 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (explaining that probable cause requires only "a fair probability," and not "certainty, or proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or proof by a preponderance ofthe evidence").

--constituted prosecutable violations of

the campaign-finance laws. The Office determinedthat the evidence wasnot sufficient to charge

either incident as a criminal violation.

a. Overview Of Governing Law

"[T]he United States has a compelling interest... in limiting the participation offoreign citizens in activities of democratic self-government, and in thereby preventing foreign influence over the U.S. political process." Bluman v. FEC, 800 F. Supp. 2d 281, 288 (D.D.C. 2011) (Kavanaugh,J., for three-judge court), aff'd, 565 U.S. 1104 (2012). To that end, federal campaignfinance law broadly prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions, donations, expenditures, or other disbursements in connection with federal, state, or local candidate elections, and prohibits anyone from soliciting, accepting, or receiving such contributions or donations. As relevanthere, foreign nationals may not make--and noone may "solicit, accept, or receive" from them--"a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value" or "an express or implied promise to makea contribution or donation,in connection with a Federal, State, or local election." 52 U.S.C. § 30121 (a)(1)(A), (a)(2).!783 The term "contribution," which is used throughout the campaign-finance law, "includes" "any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office." 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i). It excludes, among other things, "the value of [volunteer] services." 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(B)G).

Foreign nationals are also barred from making "an expenditure, independent expenditure, or disbursement for an electioneering communication." 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(C). The term "expenditure" "includes" "any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance,deposit, or gift of moneyor anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office." 52 U.S.C. § 30101(9)(A)(i). It excludes, among other things, newsstories and non-partisan get-out-the-vote activities. 52 U.S.C. §30101(9)(B)(i)-(ii). An "independent expenditure" is an expenditure "expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate" and made independently of the campaign. 52 U.S.C. § 30101(17). An "electioneering communication" is a broadcast communication that "refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office" and is made within specified time periods and targeted at the relevant electorate.
52. U.S.C. § 30104(£)(3).

The statute defines "foreign national" by reference to FARA and the Immigration and Nationality Act, with minor modification. 52 U.S.C. § 30121(b) (cross-referencing 22 U.S.C. § 611(b)(1)-(3) and 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(20), (22)). That definition yields five, sometimesoverlapping categories of foreign nationals, which include all of the individuals and entities relevant for present purposes--namely, foreign governments and political parties, individuals

283 Campaign-finance law also places financial limits on contributions, 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a), and prohibits contributions from corporations, banks, and labor unions, 52 U.S.C. § 30118(a); see Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 320 (2010). Because the conduct that the Office investigated involved possible electoral activity by foreign nationals, the foreign-contributions ban is the most readily applicable provision,

,

A "knowing[] and willful[]" violation involving an aggregate of $25,000 or more in a calendar year is a felony. 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A)(@); see Bluman, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation will require some "proofof the defendant's knowledge of the law"); United States v. Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d 573, 577 (E.D. Va. 2013) (applying willfulness standard drawn from Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 191-92 (1998)); see also Wagnerv. FEC, 793 F.3d 1, 19 n.23 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (en banc) (same). A "knowing[] and willful[]" violation involving an aggregate of $2,000 or more in a calendar year, but less than $25,000, is a misdemeanor. 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A)(ii).

b. Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting

The Office considered whether to charge Trump Campaign officials with crimes in connection with the June 9 meeting described in VolumeI, Section IV.A.5, supra. The Office concluded that, in light of the government's substantial burden of proof on issues of intent ("knowing" and "willful"), and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information, criminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that "the admissible evidence will probablybesufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction." Justice Manual § 9-27.220.

In brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an "offer" from Russia's "Crown prosecutor" to "the Trump campaign"of"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.'s] father." The email described this as "very high level and sensitive information"that is "part of Russia and its government's support to Mr. Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin." TrumpJr. responded: "if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer." Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov had follow-up conversations and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was attended by TrumpJr., Manafort, and Kushner. The communications setting up the meeting and the attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an inference that the Campaign anticipated receiving derogatory documents and information from official Russian sources that could assist candidate Trump's electoral prospects.

This series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and donations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A). Specifically, Goldstone passed along an offer purportedly from a Russian government official to provide "official documents and information" to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influencing the presidential election. Trump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those materials. Documentary evidencein the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner and Manafort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt of helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources.

The Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracyto violate the foreign contributionsban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; the solicitation of an illegal foreignsource contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of "an express or implied promise to make a

185

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WorkProduct // PrMay-Co ontain-Materialteet Fed Re -Crint d P-
[foreign-source] contribution," both in violation of 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2). There are reasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a "thing of value" within the meaningofthese provisions, but the Office determined that the government wouldnotbelikely to obtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons: first, the Office did not obtain admissible evidencelikely to meet the government's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubtthat these individuals acted "willfully," i.e., with general knowledge oftheillegality of their conduct; and, second, the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminalviolation, see 52 USS.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A)G).
i. Thing-of-Value Element A threshold legal question is whether providing to a campaign "documents and information"of the type involved here would constitute a prohibited campaign contribution. The foreign contribution ban is not limited to contributions of money. It expressly prohibits "a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value." 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2) (emphasis added). And the term "contribution" is defined throughout the campaign-finance laws to "include[]" "any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value." 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added). The phrases "thing of value" and "anything of value"are broad andinclusive enoughto encompassat least someformsof valuable information. Throughout the United States Code, these phrasesserve as "term[s] of art" that are construed "broad[ly]." United States v. Nilsen, 967 F.2d 539, 542 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) ("thing of value"includes "both tangibles and intangibles"); see also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 201(b)(1), 666(a)(2) (bribery statutes); id. § 641 (theft of government property). For example, the term "thing of value" encompasses law enforcement reports that would revealthe identity of informants, United States v. Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979); classified materials, United States v. Fowler, 932 F.2d 306, 310 (4th Cir. 1991); confidential information about a competitive bid, United States v. Matzkin, 14 F.3d 1014, 1020 (4th Cir. 1994); secret grand jury information, United States v. Jeter, 775 F.2d 670, 680 (6th Cir. 1985); and information about a witness's whereabouts, United States v. Sheker, 618 F.2d 607, 609 (9th Cir. 1980) (per curiam). Andin the public corruption context, "`thing of value' is defined broadly to include the value which the defendant subjectively attachesto the items received." United States vy. Renzi, 769 F.3d 731, 744 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations recognize the value to a campaign ofat least some forms ofinformation,stating that the term "anything of value" includes"the provision of any goods or services without charge," such as "membership lists" and "mailing lists." 11 C.F.R. § 100.52(d)(1). The FEC has concluded that the phrase includes a state-by-state list of activists. See Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. FEC, 475 F.3d 337, 338 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (describing the FEC's findings). Likewise, polling data provided to a campaign constitutes a "contribution." FEC Advisory Opinion 1990-12 (Strub), 1990 WL 153454 (citing 11 C.F.R. § 106.4(b)). And in the specific context of the foreign-contributions ban, the FEC has concluded that "election materials used in previous Canadian campaigns," including "flyers, advertisements, door hangers,tri-folds, signs, and other printed material," constitute "anything of
186

U.S. Departmentof Justice Werk // PrMay-Co ontain-Materialtect Fed Re -Crim P_d 6fe)
value," even though "the value of these materials may be nominalordifficult to ascertain." FEC
Advisory Opinion 2007-22 (Hurysz), 2007 WL 5172375, at *5. These authorities would support the view that candidate-related opposition research given
to a campaign for the purpose ofinfluencing an election could constitute a contribution to which the foreign-source ban could apply. A campaign canbeassisted not only by the provision of funds, but also by the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns frequently conduct andpay for opposition research. A foreign entity that engaged in such research and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and a greater tendency to ingratiate the donorto the candidate, than a gift of moneyor tangible things of value. At the same time, no judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of uncompensatedopposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount to a contribution under campaign-finance law. Such an interpretation could have implications beyond the foreign-source ban, see 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a) (imposing monetary limits on campaign contributions), and raise First Amendmentquestions. Those questionscould beespecially difficult where the information consisted simply of the recounting ofhistorically accurate facts. It is uncertain how courts would resolve those issues.
ii. Willfulness Even assuming that the promised "documents and information that would incriminate Hillary" constitute a "thing of value" under campaign-finance law, the government would encounterother challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction. Mostsignificantly, the governmenthasnotobtained admissible evidencethatis likely to establish the scienter requirement beyond a reasonable doubt. To prove that a defendant acted "knowingly and willfully," the government would haveto showthat the defendant had general knowledge that his conduct was unlawful. U.S. Departmentof Justice, Federal Prosecution ofElection Offenses 123 (8th ed. Dec. 2017) ("Election Offenses'); see Bluman, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation requires "proof of the defendant's knowledge of the law"); Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 577 ("knowledge of general unlawfulness"). "This standard creates an elevated scienter element requiring,at the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question befairly clear. When there is substantial doubt concerning whether the law appliesto the facts of a particular matter, the offender is morelikely to have an intent defense." Election Offenses 123. On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubtthat the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledgethat their conduct was unlawful. The investigation has not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar with the foreign-contribution banorthe application of federal law to the relevant factual context. The governmentdoes not have strong evidenceof surreptitious behavior or efforts at concealment at the time of the June 9 meeting. While the government has evidenceoflater efforts to prevent disclosure of the nature of the June 9 meeting that could circumstantially provide support for a showing ofscienter, see VolumeII, Section II.G, infra, that concealment occurred more than a yearlater, involved individuals who did not attend the June 9 meeting, and mayreflect an intention to avoid political consequencesrather than any prior knowledgeofillegality. Additionally, in light of the unresolved legal questions about whether giving "documents and information" of the sort offered here constitutes a campaign contribution, Trump Jr. could mount a factual defense that he
187

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney--Work // Proteeteddid not believe his response to the offer and the June 9 meetingitself violated the law. Given his less direct involvement in arranging the June 9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar defense. And, while Manafort is experienced with political campaigns, the Office has not developed evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge oftheselegal issues.
iii, Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information The Office would also encounterdifficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised documents and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal violation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1). The type of evidence commonly usedto establish the value of non-monetary contributions--such as pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost or the cost of distribution--would likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting. Although damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign, it appears that the information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable. And while value in a conspiracy may well be measured by whatthe participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement, see, e.g., United States v. Tombrello, 666 F.2d 485, 489 (11th Cir. 1982), Goldstone's description of the offered material here was quite general. His suggestion of the information's value--i.e., that it would "incriminate Hillary" and "would be very useful to [Trump Jr.'s] father"--was nonspecific and may have been understood as being of uncertain worth or reliability, given Goldstone's lack of direct access to the original source. The uncertainty over what would be delivered could be reflected in Trump Jr.'s response ("if it's what you say I love it") (emphasis added). Accordingly, taking into account the high burdento establish a culpable mentalstate in a campaign-finance prosecution andthe difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against Trump Jr. or other campaign officials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting.

ii. Willfulness As discussed, to establish a criminal campaign-finance violation, the government must provethat the defendant acted "knowingly and willfully." 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A)(i).

4, False Statements and Obstruction of the Investigation The Office determined that certain individuals associated with the Campaign lied to investigators about Campaign contacts with Russia and have taken otheractions to interfere with the investigation. As explained below, the Office therefore charged some U.S. persons connected to the Campaignwith false statements and obstruction offenses.
a. Overview Of Governing Law False Statements. The principal federal statute criminalizing false statements to governmentinvestigators is 18 U.S.C. § 1001. As relevant here, under Section 1001(a)(2), it is a crime to knowingly and willfully "make[] any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation" "in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive . . . branch of the Government." An FBIinvestigation is a matter within the Executive Branch's jurisdiction. United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 479 (1984). The statute also applies to a subset of legislative branch actions--viz., administrative matters and "investigation[s] or review[s]" conducted by a congressional committee or subcommittee. 18 U.S.C. § 1001(c)(1) and(2); see United States v. Pickett, 353 F.3d 62, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Whether the statement was made to law enforcement or congressional investigators, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the same basic non-jurisdictional elements: the statement wasfalse, fictitious, or fraudulent; the defendant knew both thatit was false and that it was unlawful to make a false statement; and the false statement was material. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 831 F.3d 1207, 1222 n.27 (9th Cir. 2017) (listing elements); see also Ninth Circuit Pattern Instruction 8.73 & cmt. (explaining that the Section 1001 jury instruction was modified in light of the DepartmentofJustice's position that the phrase "knowingly andwillfully"in the statute requires the defendant's knowledgethat his or her conduct was unlawful). In the D.C. Circuit, the government mustprove that the statement wasactually false; a statement that is misleading but "literally true" does not satisfy Section 1001(a)(2). See United States v. Milton, 8 F.3d 39, 45
191

U.S. Departmentof Justice Atterney-WorkPreduet // PrMey-Contai oMateriltect Fed R-e Crimt 2d
(D.C. Cir. 1993); United States v. Dale, 991 F.2d 819, 832-33 & n.22 (D.C. Cir. 1993). For that false statementto qualify as "material," it must have a natural tendencyto influence,or be capable of influencing, a discrete decision or any other function of the agency to whichit is addressed. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Moore, 612 F.3d 698, 701 (D.C. Cir. 2010).
Perjury. Underthe federal perjury statutes,it is a crime for a witness testifying under oath before a grandjury to knowingly makeany false material declaration. See 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The government must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction under Section 1623(a): the defendanttestified under oath before a federal grand jury; the defendant's testimony was false in one or more respects; the false testimony concerned matters that were material to the grand jury investigation; and the false testimony was knowingly given. United States v. Bridges, 717 F.2d 1444, 1449 n.30 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The general perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1621, also applies to grand jury testimony and has similar elements, exceptthat it requires that the witness have acted willfully and that the government satisfy "strict common-law requirements for establishingfalsity." See Dunn v. United States, 442 U.S. 100, 106 & n.6 (1979) (explaining "the two-witness rule" and the corroboration that it demands).
Obstruction of Justice. Three basic elements are common to the obstruction statutes pertinent to this Office's charging decisions: an obstructive act; some form of nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and criminal(i.e., corrupt) intent. A detailed discussion of those elements, and the law governing obstruction of justice more generally, is included in VolumeII of the report.
b. Application to Certain Individuals i. George Papadopoulos
Investigators approached Papadopoulos for an interview based on his role as a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign and his suggestion to a foreign governmentrepresentative that Russia had indicated that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymousrelease of information damaging to candidate Clinton. On January 27, 2017, Papadopoulos agreed to be interviewed by FBIagents, who informed him that the interview waspart of the investigation into potential Russian governmentinterference in the 2016 presidential election.
During the interview, Papadopoulos lied about the timing, extent, and nature of his communications with Joseph Mifsud, Olga Polonskaya, and Ivan Timofeev. With respect to timing, Papadopoulos acknowledgedthat he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians had "dirt" on Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails." But Papadopoulos stated multiple times that those communications occurred before he joined the Trump Campaign andthatit was a "very strange coincidence"to be told of the "dirt" before he started working for the Campaign. This account was false. Papadopoulos met Mifsudforthe first time on approximately March 14, 2016, after Papadopoulos had already learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for the Campaign. Mifsud showed interest in Papadopoulos only after learning of his role on the Campaign. And Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the Russians possessing "dirt" on candidate Clinton in late April 2016, more than a month after Papadopoulos had joined the Campaign and
192

U.S. Department of Justice Atterney-WerlkPreduet // PrMay-Conti oMateriltect Fed -Re -Critt 2-d 60)
been publicly announced by candidate Trump. Statement of Offense J 25-26, United States v. George Papadopoulos, No. 1:17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Oct. 5, 2017), Doc. 19 ("Papadopoulos Statement of Offense").
Papadopoulos also made false statements in an effort to minimize the extent and importance of his communications with Mifsud. For example, Papadopoulos stated that "[Mifsud]'s a nothing," that he thought Mifsud was "just a guy talk[ing] up connections or something,"andthat he believed Mifsud was "BS'ing to be completely honest with you." In fact, however, Papadopoulos understood Mifsud to have substantial connections to high-level Russian governmentofficials and that Mifsud spoke with someofthose officials in Moscow beforetelling Papadopoulos aboutthe "dirt." Papadopoulos also engaged in extensive communications over a period of months with Mifsud about foreign policy issues for the Campaign, including efforts to arrange a "history making" meeting between the Campaign and Russian governmentofficials. In addition, Papadopoulosfailed to inform investigators that Mifsud hadintroduced him to Timofeev, the Russian national who Papadopoulos understood to be connected to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite being asked if he had met with Russian nationals or "[aJnyone with a Russian accent" during the campaign. Papadopoulos Statement of Offense {J 27-29.
Papadopoulosalsofalsely claimed that he met Polonskaya before he joined the Campaign, and falsely told the FBI that he had "no"relationship at all with her. He stated that the extent of their communications was her sending emails--"Just, `Hi, how are you?' That's it." In truth, however, Papadopoulos met Polonskaya on March 24, 2016, after he had joined the Campaign; he believed that she had connections to high-level Russian governmentofficials and could help him arrange a potential foreign policy trip to Russia. During the campaign he emailed and spoke with her over Skype on numerous occasions about the potential foreign policy trip to Russia. Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ff 30-31.
Papadopoulos's false statements in January 2017 impeded the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediately, those statements hindered investigators' ability to effectively question Mifsud when he wasinterviewedin the lobby of a Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017. See Gov't Sent. Mem. at 6, United States v. George Papadopoulos, No. 1:17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Aug. 18, 2017), Doc. 44. During that interview, Mifsud admitted to knowing Papadopoulos and to having introduced him to Polonskaya and Timofeev. But Mifsud denied that he had advance knowledge that Russia was in possession of emails damaging to candidate Clinton, stating that he and Papadopoulos had discussed cybersecurity and hackingas a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstoodtheir conversation. Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen Papadopoulossince the meeting at which Mifsud introduced him to Polonskaya, even though emails, text messages, and other information show that Mifsud met with Papadopoulos onat least two other occasions--April 12 and April 26, 2016. In addition, Mifsud omitted that he had drafted (or edited) the follow-up message that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulosfollowing the initial meeting and that, as reflected in the language of that email chain (""Baby, thank you!"), Mifsud may have been involved in a personal relationship with Polonskaya at the time. The false information and omissions in Papadopoulos's January 2017 interview undermined investigators' ability to challenge Mifsud when he madethese inaccurate statements.

Given the seriousnessof the lies and omissionsandtheir effect on the FBI's investigation, the Office charged Papadopoulos with makingfalse statements to the FBI,in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Information, United States v. George Papadopoulos, No. 1:17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Oct.3, 2017), Doc. 8. On October 7, 2017, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to that charge pursuantto a plea agreement. On September7, 2018, he was sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment, a $9,500 fine, and 200 hours of community service.
iii. Michael Flynn Michael Flynn agreed to be interviewed by the FBI on January 24, 2017, four days after he had officially assumed his duties as National Security Advisor to the President. During the interview, Flynn madeseveralfalse statements pertaining to his communications with the Russian ambassador. First, Flynn made two false statements about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Kislyakin late December 2016, at a time when the United States had imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering with the 2016 presidential election and Russia was considering its response. See Flynn Statement of Offense. Flynn told the agents that he did not ask Kislyak to refrain from escalating the situation in response to the United States's imposition of sanctions. That statement wasfalse. On December 29, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to request Russian restraint. Flynn made the call immediately after speaking to a senior Transition Team official (K.T. McFarland) about what to communicate to Kislyak. Flynn then spoke with McFarland againafter the Kislyak call to report on the substance of that conversation. Flynn also falsely told the FBI that he did not remembera follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to the U.S. sanctions as a result of Flynn's request. On December 31, 2016, Flynn in fact had such a conversation with Kislyak, and he again spoke with McFarland within hours of the call to relay the substance of his conversation with Kislyak. See Flynn Statement of Offense {| 3.

Second, Flynn madefalse statements aboutcalls he had previously made to representatives of Russia and other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically, Flynn stated that he only asked the countries' positions on how they would vote on the resolution and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. That statement was false. On December22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak, informed him ofthe incoming Trump Administration's opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn also falsely stated that Kislyak never described Russia's response to his December 22 request regarding the resolution. Kislyakin fact told Flynn in a conversation on December 23, 2016, that Russia would not vote against the resolutionif it came to a vote. See Flynn Statement of Offense 44.
Flynn madethese false statements to the FBI at a time when he wasserving as National Security Advisor and whenthe FBI had anopen investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including the nature of any links between the Trump Campaign and Russia. Flynn's false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on that ongoing investigation. Flynn Statement of Offense f{ 1-2. They also came shortly before Flynn made separate submissions to the Departmentof Justice, pursuant to FARA,that also contained materially false statements and omissions. Jd. | 5. Based onthetotality of that conduct, the Office decided to charge Flynn with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a). On December 1, 2017, and pursuant to a plea agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to that charge and also admitted his false statements to the Department in his FARA filing. See id.; Plea Agreement, United States v. Michael T. Flynn, No. 1:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 3. Flynn is awaiting sentencing.
iv. Michael Cohen Michael Cohen was the executive vice president and special counsel to the Trump Organization when Trump waspresident of the Trump Organization. Information 1, United States v. Cohen, No. 1:18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2018), Doc. 2 ("Cohen Information"). From the fall of 2015 through approximately June 2016, Cohen wasinvolved in a project to build a Trump-branded tower and adjoining development in Moscow. The project was known as Trump Tower Moscow. In 2017, Cohen wascalled to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between Russia andthe presidential campaigns. In late August 2017, in advance of his testimony, Cohen caused a two-page statement to be sent to SSCI and HPSCI addressing Trump Tower Moscow. Cohen Information {J 2-3. The letter contained three representations relevant here. First, Cohen stated that the Trump Moscowproject had ended in January 2016 andthat he had briefed candidate Trump on the project only three times before making the unilateral decision to terminate it. Second, Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project and never considered asking Trump totravel for the project. Third, Cohen stated that he did not recall any Russian government contact about the project, including any response to an email that
195

U.S. Department of Justice AtterneyWorkProduet // PrMay-Conti oMateriltect Fed-Re -Crinr d 2-6) he had sent to a Russian government email account. Cohen Information J 4. Cohen later asked that his two-page statement be incorporated into his testimony's transcript before SSCI, and he ultimately gave testimony to SSCIthat was consistent with that statement. Cohen Information { 5.
Each of the foregoing representations in Cohen's two-page statement was false and misleading. Consideration of the project had extended through approximately June 2016 and included morethan three progress reports from Cohen to Trump. Cohen had discussed with Felix Sater his owntravel to Russia as part of the project, and he had inquired aboutthe possibility of Trumptraveling there--both with the candidate himself and with senior campaign official Corey Lewandowski. Cohendid recall that he had received a response to the email that he sent to Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov--inparticular, that he received an email reply and had a follow-up phone conversation with an English-speakingassistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016. Cohen Information | 7. Cohen knew the statements in the letter to be false at the time, and admitted that he made them in an effort (1) to minimize the links between the project and Trump (who bythis time was President), and (2) to give the false impression that the project had ended before the first vote in the Republican Party primary process, in the hopesof limiting the ongoing Russia investigations. Id.
Giventhenature ofthe false statements and the fact that he repeated them duringhis initial interview with the Office, we charged Cohen withviolating Section 1001. On November29, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to a single-count information charging him with making false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2) and (c). Cohen Information. The case was transferred to the district judge presiding over the separate prosecution of Cohen pursued by the Southern District of New York(after a referral from our Office). On December 7, 2018, this Office submitted a letter to that judge recommending that Cohen's cooperation with our investigation be taken into accountin sentencing Cohen onboththe false-statements charge and the offenses in the Southern District prosecution. On December 12, 2018, the judge sentenced Cohen to two months of imprisonment on the false-statements count, to run concurrently with a 36-month sentence imposed on the other counts.

Harm to Ongoing Matter vi. JeffSessions
Asset forth in VolumeI, Section IV.A.6, supra,the investigation established that, while a U.S. Senator and a Trump Campaign advisor, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions interacted with Russian AmbassadorKislyak during the week of the Republican National Convention in July 2016 and again at a meeting in Sessions's Senateoffice in September 2016. The investigation also established that Sessions and Kislyak both attended a reception held before candidate Trump's
197

U.S. Departmentof Justice Atterney-WorkPreduet // Preteeted-Lnder
foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in April 2016, and that it is possible that they metbriefly at that reception.
The Office considered whether,in light of these interactions, Sessions committed perjury before, or made false statements to, Congress in connection with his confirmation as Attorney General. In January 2017 testimony during his confirmation hearing, Sessions stated in response to a question about Trump Campaign communications with the Russian government that he had "been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have -- did not have communicationswith the Russians." In written responses submitted on January 17, 2017, Sessions answered "[n]o" to a question asking whether he had "been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before orafter election day." And, in a March 2017 supplementto his testimony, Sessionsidentified two of the campaign-period contacts with Ambassador Kislyak noted above, which had been reported in the media following the January 2017 confirmation hearing. Sessions stated in the supplemental response that he did "not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador, or any other representatives of the Russian government, regarding thepolitical campaign on these occasionsor any other occasion."
Although the investigation established that Sessions interacted with Kislyak on the occasions described above and that Kislyak mentioned the presidential campaign on at least one occasion, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to Russia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions. With respect to Sessions's statements that he did "not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador.. . regarding the political campaign" and he had not been in contact with any Russianofficial "about the 2016 election," the evidence concerning the nature of Sessions's interactions with Kislyak makesit plausible that Sessions did not recall discussing the campaign with Kislyakat the time of his statements. Similarly, while Sessions stated in his January 2017 oral testimony that he "did not have communications with Russians," he did so in response to a question that had linked such communications to an alleged "continuing exchange of information" between the Trump Campaign and Russian government intermediaries. Sessions later explained to the Senate and to the Office that he understood the question as narrowly calling for disclosure of interactions with Russiansthat involved the exchange of campaign information, as distinguished from more routine contacts with Russian nationals. Given the context in which the question was asked, that understanding is plausible.
Accordingly,the Office concludedthat the evidence wasinsufficient to prove that Sessions waswillfully untruthful in his answers and thus insufficient to obtain or sustain a conviction for perjury or false statements. Consistent with the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office therefore determined not to pursue charges against Sessions and informed his counsel of that decision in March 2018.
vii. Others Interviewed During the Investigation The Office considered whether, during the course of the investigation, other individuals interviewed either omitted material information or provided information determined to be false. Applying the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office did not seek criminal charges against any individuals other than those listed above. In some instances, that decision was due to

INTRODUCTION TO VOLUMEIT
This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which states that, "[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special Counsel] reached."
Beginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards the ongoing FBI investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters that raised questions about whetherhe had obstructed justice. The Order appointing the Special Counsel gave this Office jurisdiction to investigate matters that arose directly from the FBI's Russia investigation, including whether the President had obstructed justice in connection with Russia-related investigations. The Special Counsel's jurisdiction also covered potentially obstructive acts related to the Special Counsel's investigation itself. This Volume of our report summarizes our obstruction-of-justice investigation of the President.
Wefirst describe the considerations that guided our obstruction-of-justice investigation, and then provide an overview of this Volume:
First, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to initiate or decline a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinionfindingthat"the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions" in violation of "the constitutional separation of powers."! Giventhe role of the Special Counselas an attorney in the Department ofJustice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. § 515; 28 C.F.R. § 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC's legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial jurisdiction. And apart from OLC's constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President's capacity to govern andpotentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct."
Second, while the OLC opinion concludesthat a sitting President may not be prosecuted, it recognizesthat a criminal investigation during the President's term is permissible? The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leavesoffice. And if individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in

3 OLC Op. at 257 n.36 ("A grand jury could continue to gather evidence throughout the period of immunity").

safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual * investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary
materials were available.

Third, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determinednot to apply an approachthat could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. The threshold step under the Justice Manual standards is to assess whether a person's conduct "constitutes a federal offense." U.S. Dep't of Justice, Justice Manual § 9-27.220 (2018) (Justice Manual). Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor's judgmentthat crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.5

The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case ofa sitting President, where a federal prosecutor's accusation of a crime, even in an internal report, could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice. OLC noted similar concerns aboutsealed indictments. Even if an indictment were sealed during the President's term, OLC reasoned, "it would be very difficult to preserve [an indictment's] secrecy," and if an indictment becamepublic, "[t]he stigma and opprobrium" could imperil the President's ability to govern."6 Although a prosecutor's internal report would not represent a formal public accusation akin to an indictment, the possibility of the report's public disclosure and the absence of a neutral adjudicatory forum to review its findings counseled against potentially determining "that the person's conduct constitutes a federal offense." Justice Manual § 9-27.220.

Fourth, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President
clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not concludethat the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYTO VOLUMEII

Our obstruction-of-justice inquiry focused on a series of actions by the President that related to the Russian-interference investigations, including the President's conduct towards the law enforcementofficials overseeing the investigations and the witnesses to relevant events.

FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION

The key issues and events we examined include the following:

The Campaign's response to reports about Russian supportfor Trump. During the 2016

presidential campaign, questions arose about the Russian government's apparent support for

candidate Trump. After WikiLeaksreleased politically damaging Democratic Party emails that

were reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump publicly expressed skepticism that Russia

was responsible for the hacks at the same time that he and other Campaignofficials privately

sought information

about any further planned WikiLeaks

releases. Trumpalso denied having any business in or connections to Russia, even though aslate

as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a licensing deal for a skyscraper to be

built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow.After the election, the President expressed concerns

to advisors that reports of Russia's election interference might lead the public to question the

legitimacy of his election.

Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn. In mid-January 2017, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to the Vice President, other administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about Russia's response to U.S. sanctions on Russia forits election interference. On January 27, the day after the President wastold that Flynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar statements to the FBI, the President invited FBI Director Comeyto a private dinner at the White House and told Comey that he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President requested Flynn's resignation, the President told an outside advisor, "Now that we fired Flynn,the Russia thing is over." The advisor disagreed andsaid the investigations would continue.

Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting with Comey. Referring to the FBI's investigation of Flynn, the President said, "I hope you can see your way clearto letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you canlet this go." Shortly after requesting Flynn's resignation and speaking privately to Comey,the President sought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internalletter stating that the President had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined because she did not know whether that was true, and a White House Counsel's Office attorney thoughtthat the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorshipshehadbeenoffered.

The President's reaction to the continuing Russia investigation. In February 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whetherhe had to recuse himself from campaignrelated investigations becauseofhis role in the Trump Campaign. In early March, the President told White House Counsel Donald McGahnto stop Sessions from recusing. And after Sessions announcedhis recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at the decision andtold advisors that he should have an Attorney General who would protect him. That weekend, the President took Sessions aside at an event and urged him to "unrecuse." Later in March, Comey publicly

disclosed at a congressional hearing that the FBI was investigating "the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election," including anylinks or coordination between the Russian governmentand the Trump Campaign. In the following days, the President reached out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA)to ask them what they could doto publicly dispel the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort. The President also twice called Comeydirectly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahnto avoid direct contacts with the Department of Justice. Comey had previously assured the Presidentthat the FBI wasnotinvestigating him personally, and the President asked Comey to"lift the cloud" of the Russia investigation by saying that publicly.
The President's termination of Comey. On May 3, 2017, Comeytestified in a congressional hearing, but declined to answer questions about whether the President was personally underinvestigation. Within days, the President decided to terminate Comey. The President insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release, state that Comey had informed the President that he was not under investigation. The dayof the firing, the White House maintained that Comey's termination resulted from independent recommendations from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the President had decided to fire Comey before hearing from the Departmentof Justice. The day after firing Comey, the President told Russian officials that he had "faced great pressure because of Russia," which had been "taken offby Comey's firing. The next day, the President acknowledgedin a television interview that he was going to fire Comeyregardless of the Departmentof Justice's recommendation and that when he "decided to just doit," he was thinking that "this thing with Trump and Russia is a made-upstory." In responseto a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia investigation, the President said, "As far as I'm concerned, I wantthat thing to be absolutely done properly," adding thatfiring Comey "might even lengthen out the investigation."
The appointmentof a Special Counselandefforts to remove him. On May17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a Special Counsel to conductthe investigation and related matters. The President reacted to news that a Special Counsel had been appointedbytelling advisors that it was "the end of his presidency" and demanding that Sessions resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it. The Presidenttold aides that the Special Counsel hadconflicts of interest and suggested that the Special Counsel therefore could not serve. The President's advisors told him the asserted conflicts were meritless and had already been considered by the Departmentof Justice.
On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel's Office was investigating whetherthe President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this "a major turning point" in the investigation: while Comey had told the President he was not under investigation, following Comey's firing, the President now was under investigation. The President reacted to this news with a series of tweets criticizing the Department of Justice and the Special Counsel's investigation. On June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn at home and directed him tocall the Acting Attorney Generaland say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahndid notcarry outthe direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regardedas a potential Saturday Night Massacre.

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WerkPreduet // Proteeted-Under
Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel's investigation. Two days after directing McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski,a trusted advisor outside the government, and dictated a message for Lewandowskito deliver to Sessions. The messagesaid that Sessions should publicly announcethat, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was"very unfair" to the President, the President had done nothing wrong,and Sessionsplanned to meet with the Special Counsel and "let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections." Lewandowskisaid he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do.
One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel investigation to future election interference. Lewandowskitold the President that the message would be delivered soon. Hoursafter that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that Sessions's job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President's message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.
Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence. In the summerof 2017, the President learned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaignofficials, including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was said to be offering damaging information about Hillary Clinton as "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump." Onseveral occasions, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not leak and that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited. Before the emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with "an individual who [TrumpJr.] was told might have information helpful to the campaign" and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children. When the press asked questions aboutthe President's involvement in Trump Jr.'s statement, the President's personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any role.
Further efforts to have the Attorney Generaltake controlof the investigation. \n early summer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation. Sessionsdid not reverse his recusal. In October 2017, the President met privately with Sessionsin the Oval Office and asked him to "take [a] look"at investigating Clinton. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, the President met with Sessions in the Oval Office and suggested, according to notes taken by a senior advisor, that if Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia investigation, he would be a "hero." The President told Sessions, "I'm not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly." In response, Sessions volunteered that he had never seen anything "improper" on the campaign and told the President there was a "whole new leadership team" in place. He did not unrecuse.
Efforts to have McGahn deny that the President had ordered him to have the Special Counsel removed. In early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to

U.S. Department ofJustice Atterney-WorkPreduet // Proteeted-Under
have the Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather than carry out the order. The President reacted to the newsstories by directing White House officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahntold those officials that the media reports were accuratein stating that the President had directed McGahnto have the Special Counsel removed. The President then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the reports. In the same meeting, the President also asked McGahn whyhe had told the Special Counsel about the President's effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahntook notes of his conversations with the President. McGahnrefused to back away from what he remembered happening and perceived the President to be testing his mettle.
Conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, DO. After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreementwith the President and began cooperating with the government, the President's personal counsel left a message for Flynn's attorneys reminding them of the President's warm feelings towards Flynn, which he said "still remains," and asking for a "heads up" if Flynn knew "information that implicates the President." When Flynn's counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President's personal counsel said he would makesure that the President knew that Flynn's actions reflected "hostility" towards the President. During Manafort's prosecution and when the jury in his criminal, trial was deliberating, the President praised Manafort in public, said that Manafort was being treated unfairly, and declined to rule out a pardon. After Manafort was convicted, the President called Manafort "a brave man" for refusing to "break" and said that "flipping" "almost ought to be outlawed." GET w iEvacre
Conduct involving Michael Cohen. The President's conduct towards Michael Cohen, a former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise for Cohen whenhe falsely minimized the President's involvement in the Trump Tower Moscowproject, to castigation of Cohen when he became a cooperating witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the Trump Tower Moscowproject on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed candidate Trump on the project numeroustimes, including discussing whether Trump shouldtravel to Russia to advance the deal. In 2017, Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about the project, including stating that he had only briefed Trump on the project three times and never discussed travel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhereto a "party line" that Cohen said was developed to minimizethe President's connections to Russia. While preparing for his congressional testimony, Cohenhad extensive discussions with the President's personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should "stay on message" and not contradict the President. After the FBI searched Cohen's home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not "flip," contacted him directly to tell him to "stay strong," and privately passed messagesof support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating with the governmentin the summerof 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a "rat," and suggested that his family members had committed crimes.

Overarching factual issues. We did not make a traditional prosecution decision about these facts, but the evidence weobtained supports several general statements about the President's conduct.
Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-ofjustice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President, and some of his actions, such as firing the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts within his Article IT authority, which raises constitutional issues discussed below. At the same time, the President's position as the head of the Executive Branch provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses--all of which is relevant to a potential obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crimerelated to Russianelection interference. Although the obstruction statutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of the President's intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct. Third, manyofthe President's acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the obstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnessesoralter their testimony, the harm to the justice system's integrity is the same.
Althoughtheseries of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern of the President's conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the President's acts and the inferences that can be drawn abouthis intent. In particular, the actions we investigated can be divided into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in the President's motives. The first phase coveredthe period from the President's first interactions with Comey through the President's firing of Comey. During that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally underinvestigation. Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointmentof the Special Counsel, however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point, the President engaged in a second phase of conduct, involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage witnesses notto cooperate with the investigation. Judgments about the nature of the President's motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the evidence.
STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSES
The President's counsel raised statutory and constitutional defenses to a possible obstruction-of-justice analysis of the conduct we investigated. We concluded that none of those legal defenses provided a basis for declining to investigate the facts.
Statutory defenses. Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice's general approach tointerpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply here. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) is an omnibus obstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive acts directed at pending or contemplated official proceedings. Noprinciple of statutory construction justifies narrowing the provision to cover only conduct that impairs the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections 1503 and 1505also offer broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury,
7

U.S. Departmentof Justice Atterrey-WorkProduet // PrMay-Contei oMaterilteet Fed Re -Crint d P62)
judicial, administrative, and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a provision in Section 1512(b) aimed specifically at conduct intended to preventor hinder the communication to law enforcement of information related to a federal crime.
Constitutional defenses. As for constitutional defenses arising from the President's status as the head of the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Departmentof Justice and the courts have not. definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those issues through the framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues. The Department of Justice and the President's personal counsel have recognized that the Presidentis subject to statutes that prohibit obstruction of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury because that conduct doesnot implicate his constitutional authority. With respect to whether the President can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers underArticle II of the Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration ofjustice.
Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II powers. The separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official proceedings, including those of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts regardlessof their source. We also concludedthat any inroadonpresidential authority that would occur from prohibiting corruptacts does not undermine the President's ability to fulfill his constitutional mission. The term "corruptly" sets a demanding standard. It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someoneelse, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others. A preclusion of "corrupt" official action does not diminish the President's ability to exercise Article Il powers. For example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demandfreedom for the Presidentto act with a corrupt intention ofshielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financialliability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt purposes furthers, rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration ofthe law. It also aligns with the President's constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws. Finally, we concluded that in the rare case in which a criminal investigation of the President's conduct is justified, inquiries to determine whether the President acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance of his constitutionally assigned duties. The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balancesandtheprinciple that no person is abovethe law.
CONCLUSION
Because we determined not to makea traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct. The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation ofthe facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction ofjustice, we would so state. Based on thefacts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.

I. BACKGROUND LEGAL AND EVIDENTIARY PRINCIPLES

A.

Legal Frameworkof Obstruction of Justice

The May 17, 2017 Appointment Order and the Special Counsel regulations provide this Office with jurisdiction to investigate "federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses." 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). Because of that description ofourjurisdiction, we sought evidence for our obstruction-of-justice investigation with the elements of obstruction offenses in mind. Our evidentiary analysis is similarly focused on the elements of such offenses, although we do not draw conclusions on the ultimate questions that govern a prosecutorial decision underthe Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual § 9-27.000 et seq. (2018).

Here, we summarize the law interpreting the elements of potentially relevant obstruction statutes in an ordinary case. This discussion does not address the uniqueconstitutional issues that arise in an inquiry into official acts by the President. Those issues are discussed in a later section of this report addressing constitutional defenses that the President's counsel have raised. See Volume II, Section III.B, infra.

Three basic elements are common to most of the relevant obstruction statutes: (1) an obstructive act; (2) a nexus betweenthe obstructive act and an official proceeding; and (3) a corrupt intent. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(c)(2). We describe those elements as they have beeninterpreted by the courts. We then discuss a more specific statute aimed at witness tampering, see 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b), and describe the requirements for attempted offenses and endeavors to obstruct justice, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1512(c)(2).

Obstructive act. Obstruction-of-justice law "reaches all corrupt conduct capable of producing an effect that prevents justice from being duly administered, regardless of the means employed." United States v. Silverman, 745 F.2d 1386, 1393 (11th Cir. 1984) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1503). An "effort to influence" a proceeding can qualify as an endeavor to obstruct justice even if the effort was "subtle or circuitous" and "however cleverly or with whatever cloaking of purpose" it was made. United States v. Roe, 529 F.2d 629, 632 (4th Cir. 1975); see also United States v. Quattrone, 441 F.3d 153, 173 (2d Cir. 2006). The verbs "`obstruct or impede' are broad" and"can refer to anything that blocks, makesdifficult, or hinders." Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted).

An improper motive can render an actor's conduct criminal even when the conduct would otherwise be lawful and within the actor's authority. See United States v. Cueto, 151 F.3d 620, 631 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming obstruction conviction ofa criminal defense attorney for "litigationrelated conduct"); United States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 992 (1st Cir. 1987) ("any act by any party--whether lawful or unlawful on its face--may abridge § 1503 if performed with a corrupt motive").

Nexus to a pending or contemplated official proceeding. Obstruction-of-justice law generally requires a nexus, or connection,to an official proceeding. In Section 1503, the nexus mustbe to pending "judicial or grand jury proceedings." United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593,

U.S. Department ofJustice Arttorney--WorkPreduet // Protected
599 (1995). In Section 1505, the nexus can include a connection to a "pending" federal agency proceeding or a congressionalinquiry or investigation. Under both statutes, the government must demonstrate "a relationship in time, causation, or logic" between the obstructive act and the proceeding or inquiry to be obstructed. Jd. at 599; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v. UnitedStates, 544 U.S. 696, 707-708 (2005). Section 1512(c) prohibits obstructive efforts aimed at official proceedings including judicial or grand jury proceedings. 18 U.S.C. § 1515(a)(1)(A). "For purposes of" Section 1512, "an official proceeding need not be pending or aboutto be instituted at the time of the offense." 18 U.S.C. § 1512(f)(1). Although a proceeding need notalready bein progressto trigger liability under Section 1512(c), a nexus to a contemplated proceedingstill must be shown. United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v. Petruk, 781 F.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007). The nexus requirement narrows the scope of obstruction statutes to ensure that individuals have "fair warning" of what the law proscribes. Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The nexus showing has subjective and objective components. As an objective matter, a defendant must act "in a manner thatis /ikely to obstruct justice," such that the statute "excludes defendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably be successful." Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). "(T]he endeavor must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice." Jd. at 599 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As a subjective matter, the actor must have "contemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding." Petruk, 781 F.3d at 445-446.. A defendant need not directly impede the proceeding. Rather, a nexusexists if "discretionary actions of a third person would be required to obstruct the judicial proceedingif it was foreseeable to the defendantthat the third party would act on the [defendant's] communication in such a wayasto obstruct the judicial proceeding." United States v. Martinez, 862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. 2017) (brackets,ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted).
Corruptly. The word "corruptly" provides the intent element for obstruction ofjustice and means acting "knowingly and dishonestly" or "with an improper motive." United States v. Richardson, 676 F.3d 491, 508 (5th Cir. 2012); United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151 (10th Cir. 2013) (to act corruptly means to "act[] with an improper purpose and to engage in conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert, impede or obstruct" the relevant proceeding) (some quotation marks omitted); see 18 U.S.C. § 1515(b) ("As used in section 1505, the term `corruptly' means acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing another."); see also Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 705-706 (interpreting "corruptly" to mean "wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil" and holding that acting "knowingly . . . corruptly" in 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b) requires "consciousness of wrongdoing"). The requisite showing is made when a person acted with an intent to obtain an "improper advantage for [him]self or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others." BALLENTINE'S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F.3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (characterizing this definition as the "longstanding and well-accepted meaning"of "corruptly").
Witness tampering. A morespecific provision in Section 1512 prohibits tampering with a witness. See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(1), (3) (making it a crime to "knowingly use[] intimidation ... or corruptly persuade[] another person," or "engage[] in misleading conduct towards another
10

U.S. Departmentof Justice Atterney-WorkPreduet // Proteeted-Gnder
person,"with the intent to "influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any personin anofficial proceeding" or to "hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcementofficer. . . of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense"). To establish corrupt persuasion, it is sufficient that the defendant asked a potential witness to lie to investigators in contemplationof a likely federal investigation into his conduct. UnitedStatesv. Edlind, 887 F.3d 166, 174 (4th Cir. 2018); United States v. Sparks, 791 F.3d 1188, 1191-1192 (10th Cir. 2015); United States v. Byrne, 435 F.3d 16, 23-26 (Ist Cir. 2006); United States v. LaShay, 417 F.3d 715, 718-719 (7th Cir. 2005); United States v. Burns, 298 F.3d 523, 539-540 (6th Cir. 2002); United States v. Pennington, 168 F.3d 1060, 1066 (8th Cir. 1999). The "persuasion" need not be coercive, intimidating, or explicit; it is sufficient to "urge," "induce," "ask[]," "argu[e]," "giv[e] reasons," Sparks, 791 F.3d at 1192, or "coach[] or remind[] witnesses by planting misleading facts," Edlind, 887 F.3d at 174. Corrupt persuasion is shown "where a defendanttells a potential witness a false story asif the story were true, intending that the witness believe the story and testify to it." United States v. Rodolitz, 786 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. 1986); see United States v. Gabriel, 125 F.3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 1997). It also covers urging a witness to recall a fact that the witness did not know, evenif the fact was actually true. See LaShay, 417 F.3d at 719. Corrupt persuasion also can be shownin certain circumstances when a person, with an improper motive, urges a witness not to cooperate with law enforcement. See United States v. Shotts, 145 F.3d 1289, 1301 (11th Cr. 1998) (telling Secretary "not to [say] anything [to the FBI] and [she] would not be bothered").
Whenthe chargeis acting with the intent to hinder, delay, or prevent the communication of information to law enforcement under Section 1512(b)(3), the "nexus" to a proceeding inquiry articulated in Aguilar--that an individual have "knowledge that his actionsare likely to affect the judicial proceeding," 515 U.S. at 599--does not apply because the obstructive act is aimed at the communication of information to investigators, not at impeding an official proceeding.
Acting "knowingly . . . corruptly" requires proof that the individual was "conscious of wrongdoing." Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 705-706 (declining to explore "[t]he outer limits of this element" but indicating that an instruction was infirm whereit permitted conviction even if the defendant"honestly and sincerely believed that [the] conduct was lawful"). It is an affirmative defensethat "the conduct consisted solely of lawful conduct andthat the defendant's sole intention was to encourage, induce, or cause the otherperson to testify truthfully." 18 U.S.C. § 1512(e).
Attempts and endeavors. Section 1512(c)(2) covers both substantive obstruction offenses and attempts to obstruct justice. Under general principles of attempt law, a person is guilty of an attempt when he has the intent to commit a substantive offense and takes an overt act that constitutes a substantial step towards that goal. See United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. 102, 106-107 (2007). "[T]he act [must be] substantial, in that it was strongly corroborative of the defendant's criminal purpose." United States v. Pratt, 351 F.3d 131, 135 (4th Cir. 2003). While "mere abstract talk" does not suffice, any "concrete and specific" acts that corroborate the defendant's intent can constitute a "substantial step." United States v. Irving, 665 F.3d 1184, 11981205 (10th Cir. 2011). Thus, "soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime" may qualify as a substantial step. Model Penal Code § 5.01(2)(g); see United States v. Lucas, 499 F.3d 769, 781 (8th Cir. 2007).

The omnibus clause of 18 U.S.C. § 1503 prohibits an "endeavor" to obstruct justice, which sweeps more broadly than Section 1512's attempt provision. See United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287, 302 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th Cir. 1988) (collecting cases). "It is well established that a[n] [obstruction-of-justice] offense is complete when one corruptly endeavors to obstruct or impede the due administration of justice; the prosecution need not prove that the due administration of justice was actually obstructed or impeded." United States v. Davis, 854 F.3d 1276, 1292 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Investigative and Evidentiary Considerations

After the appointment of the Special Counsel, this Office obtained evidence about the following eventsrelating to potential issues of obstruction ofjustice involving the President:

(a) The President's January 27, 2017 dinner with former FBI Director James Comey in which the President reportedly asked for Comey's loyalty, one day after the White House had been briefed by the Departmentof Justice on contacts between former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the Russian Ambassador;

(b) The President's February 14, 2017 meeting with Comeyin which the President reportedly asked Comeynotto pursue an investigation of Flynn;

(c) The President's private requests to Comey to make public the fact that the President was not the subject of an FBIinvestigation and to lift what the President regardedas a cloud;

(d) The President's outreach to the Director of National Intelligence and the Directors of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency about the FBI's Russia investigation;

(ec) The President's stated rationales for terminating Comey on May 9, 2017, including statements that could reasonably be understood as acknowledging that the FBI's Russia investigation wasa factor in Comey's termination; and

(f) The President's reported involvementin issuing a statement aboutthe June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russians and senior Trump Campaign officials that said the meeting was about adoption and omitted that the Russians had offered to provide the Trump Campaign with derogatory information aboutHillary Clinton.

Taking into account that information and our analysis of applicable statutory and constitutional principles (discussed below in Volume I], Section III, infra), we determined that there was a sufficient factual and legal basis to further investigate potential obstruction-of-justice issues involving the President.

Manyof the core issues in an obstruction-of-justice investigation turn on an individual's actions and intent. We therefore requested that the White House provide us with documentary evidence in its possession on the relevant events. We also sought and obtained the White House's concurrence in our conductinginterviews of White House personnel who hadrelevant information. And we interviewed other witnesses who had pertinent knowledge, obtained documents on a

12

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WorkPreduet // PrMay-Contei oMateriltect Fed-Re -Crint d 2-6}
voluntary basis when possible, and used legal process where appropriate. These investigative steps allowed us to gather a substantial amount of evidence.
Wealso sought a voluntary interview with the President. After more than a year of discussion, the President declined to be interviewed.
During the course of our discussions, the President did agree to answer written questions on certain Russia-related topics, and he
provided us with answers. He did not similarly agree to provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions on events during the transition. Ultimately, while we believed that wehadthe authority andlegaljustification to issue a grand jury subpoenato obtain the President's testimony, we chose not to do so. We madethat decision in view of the substantial delay that such an investigative step would likely produce ata late stage in our investigation. We also assessed that based on the significant body of evidence we had already obtained of the President's actions and his public and private statements describing or explaining those actions, we had sufficient evidence to understand relevant events and to make certain assessments without the President's testimony. The Office's decision-making process on this issue is described in more detail in Appendix C, infra, in a note that precedes the President's written responses.
In assessing the evidence weobtained, we relied on commonprinciples that apply in any investigation. The issue of criminal intent is often inferred from circumstantial evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1305 (11th Cir. 2016) ("[G]uilty knowledge can rarely be established by direct evidence. .. . Therefore, mens rea elements such as knowledge or intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence.") (internal quotation marks omitted); United States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 36 (2d Cir. 2012) ("The government's case rested on circumstantial evidence, but the mens rea elements of knowledge and intent can often be proved through circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.") (internal quotation marks omitted). The principle that intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence is a necessity in criminal cases, given the right of a subjectto assert his privilege against compelled self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment and therefore decline to testify. Accordingly, determinations on intent are frequently reached without the opportunity to interview an investigatory subject.
Obstruction-of-justice cases are consistent with this rule. See, e.g., Edlind, 887 F.3d at 174, 176 (relying on "significant circumstantial evidence that [the defendant] was conscious ofher wrongdoing" in an obstruction case; "[b]ecause evidence of intent will almost always be circumstantial, a defendant may be found culpable where the reasonable and foreseeable consequencesofheracts are the obstruction of justice") (internal quotation marks, ellipses, and punctuation omitted); Quattrone, 441 F.3d at 173-174. Circumstantial evidence that illuminates intent may include a pattern of potentially obstructive acts. Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) ("Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act... may be admissible .. . [to] prov[e] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident."); see, e.g., United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648-650 (Ist Cir. 1996); United States v. Arnold, 773 F.2d 823, 832-834 (7th Cir. 1985); Cintolo, 818 F.2d at 1000.
Credibility judgments may also be made based on objective facts and circumstantial evidence. Standard jury instructions highlight a variety of factors that are often relevant in
13

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney-Woerk-Produet // Preteeted
assessing credibility. These include whether a witness had a reason notto tell the truth; whether the witness had a good memory; whether the witness had the opportunity to observe the events about which hetestified; whether the witness's testimony was corroborated by other witnesses; and whether anything the witness said or wrote previously contradicts his testimony. See, e.g., First Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions § 1.06 (2018); Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) § 1.08 (2012); Seventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction § 3.01 (2012).
In addition to those general factors, we took into account morespecific factors in assessing the credibility of conflicting accounts ofthe facts. For example, contemporaneous written notes can provide strong corroborating evidence. See United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 232 (1975) (the fact that a "statement appeared in the contemporaneously recorded report . . . would tend strongly to corroborate the investigator's version of the interview"). Similarly, a witness's recitation of his account before he had any motive to fabricate also supports the witness's credibility. See Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 158 (1995) ("A consistent statement that predates the motive is a square rebuttal of the charge that the testimony was contrived as a consequenceof that motive."). Finally, a witness's false description of an encounter can imply consciousness of wrongdoing. See Al-Adahi v. Obama, 613 F.3d 1102, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (noting the "well-settled principle that false exculpatory statements are evidence--often strong evidence--ofguilt"). We applied those settled legal principles in evaluating the factual results of our investigation.

II, FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION

Thissection of the report details the evidence we obtained. Wefirst provide an overview of how Russia became an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, and how candidate Trump responded. Wethen turn to the key eventsthat we investigated: the President's conduct concerning the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn; the President's reaction to public confirmation of the FBI's Russia investigation; events leading up to and surrounding the termination of FBI Director Comey; efforts to terminate the Special Counsel; efforts to curtail the scope of the Special Counsel's investigation; efforts to prevent disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russians and senior campaignofficials; efforts to have the Attorney General unrecuse; and conduct towards McGahn, Cohen, and other witnesses.

Wesummarize the evidence we found andthenanalyzeit by reference to the three statutory obstruction-of-justice elements: obstructive act, nexus to a proceeding, and intent. We focus on elements because, by regulation, the Special Counsel has"jurisdiction . . . to investigate . . . federal
crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses." 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). Consistent with our jurisdiction to investigate federal obstruction crimes, we gathered evidence that is relevant to the elements of those crimes and
analyzed them within an elements framework--while refraining from reaching ultimate conclusions about whether crimes were committed, for the reasons explained above. This section also does not address legal and constitutional defenses raised by counsel for the President; those defenses are analyzed in VolumeII, SectionIII, infra.

A.

The Campaign's Response to Reports About Russian Support for Trump

During the 2016 campaign, the media raised questions abouta possible connection between the Trump Campaign and Russia.' The questions intensified after WikiLeaksreleased politically damaging Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia. Trump responded to questions aboutpossible connections to Russia by denying any business involvement in Russia--even though the Trump Organization had pursued a business project in Russia as late as June 2016. Trumpalso expressed skepticism that Russia had hacked the emails at the same time as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information about any further planned WikiLeaks releases. After the election, when questionspersisted about possible links between Russia and the Trump Campaign, the President-Elect continued to deny any connections to Russia and privately expressed concerns that reports of Russian election interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy ofhis election.*

7 This section summarizes and cites various news stories not for the truth of the information contained in the stories, but rather to place candidate Trump's responseto those stories in context. Volume I of this report analyzes the underlying facts of several relevant events that were reported on by the media during the campaign.
5 As discussed in VolumeI, while the investigation identified numerous links betweenindividuals with ties to the Russian government andindividuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives of the Russian governmentto interfere in the 2016 election.

advisors had developeda "party line" that Trump had no business with Russia and no connections to Russia."
In addition to denying any connections with Russia, the Trump Campaignreacted to reports of Russian election interference in aid of the Campaign by seeking to distance itself from Russian contacts.

The President's Conduct Concerning the Investigation of Michael Flynn

Overview

During the presidential transition, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had two phonecalls with the Russian Ambassadorto the United States about the Russian response to U.S. sanctions imposed because of Russia's election interference. After the press reported on Flynn's contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Flynn lied to incoming Administration officials by saying he had not discussed sanctions on the calls. The officials publicly repeated thoselies in press interviews. The FBI, which previously was investigating Flynn for other matters, interviewed him aboutthe calls in the first week after the inauguration, and Flynn told similarlies to the FBI. On January 26, 2017, Departmentof Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House that Flynn and the Russian Ambassador had discussed sanctions and that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI. The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James Comeyin which he asked for Comey's loyalty. On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn to resign. The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Comey in which hesaid, "T hope you can see your wayclearto letting this go, to letting Flynn go."

Flynn, who was in the Dominican Republic at the time, and K.T. McFarland, who was slated to become the Deputy National Security Advisor and was at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with the President-Elect and other seniorstaff, talked by phone about what, if anything, Flynn should
communicate to Kislyak about the sanctions.** McFarland had spoken with incoming
Administration officials about the sanctions and Russia's possible responses and thought she had mentioned in those conversations that Flynn was scheduled to speak with Kislyak.*8 Based on those conversations, McFarland informed Flynn that incoming Administration officials at Mar-aLago did not want Russiato escalate the situation.At 4:43 p.m.that afternoon, McFarlandsent an email to several officials about the sanctions and informedthe groupthat "Gen [F]lynnis talking to russian ambassadorthis evening."®>

communicated on the day the Obama Administration announced the Russia sanctions." The column questioned whether Flynn had said something to "undercut the U.S. sanctions" and
whether Flynn's communications had violated theletter or spirit of the Logan Act.!73 President-Elect Trump called Priebus after the story was published and expressed anger
aboutit.!24 Priebus recalled that the President-Elect asked, "What the hell is this all about?"!?° Priebus called Flynn and told him that the President-Elect was angry about the reporting on Flynn's conversations with Kislyak.'"° Flynn recalled that he felt a lot of pressure because Priebus had spoken to the "boss" and said Flynn neededto "kill the story."!*" Flynn directed McFarland to
call the Washington Post columnist and inform him that no discussion of sanctions had occurred.'*
McFarland recalled that Flynn said wordsto the effect of, "I wantto kill the story."!" McFarland madethecall as Flynn had requested although she knew she wasproviding false information, and the Washington Post updated the columnto reflect that a "Trumpofficial" had denied that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions.!°°

Spicer denied that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions, basing those denials on their

The public statements of incoming Administration officials denying that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions alarmed senior DOJ officials, who were aware that the statements were not true.'*4 Those officials were concerned that Flynn had lied to his colleagues--whoin turn had unwittingly misled the American public--creating a compromisesituation for Flynn because the Departmentof Justice assessed that the Russian governmentcould prove Flynnlied.'*° The FBI investigative team also believed that Flynn's calls with Kislyak and subsequent denials about discussing sanctions raised potential Logan Act issues and were relevant to the FBI's broader

about topics unrelated to sanctions.'?' Spicer's statements added to the Departmentof Justice's
concerns that Russia had leverage over Flynn based on his lies and could use that derogatory
information to compromisehim.'*8 On January 24, 2017, Flynn agreed to be interviewed by agents from the FBI.'?? During
the interview, which took placeat the White House, Flynn falsely stated that he did not ask Kislyak to refrain from escalating the situation in response to the sanctions on Russia imposed by the Obama Administration.'*° Flynn also falsely stated that he did not remember a follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of Flynn's request.'*!

4. DOJ Officials Notify the White House of Their Concerns About Flynn
On January 26, 2017, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates contacted White House Counsel Donald McGahn and informed him that she needed to discuss a sensitive matter with him in
person.'42 Later that day, Yates and Mary McCord, a senior national security official at the
Departmentof Justice, met at the White House with McGahn and White House Counsel's Office
attorney James Burnham.'? Yates said that the public statements made by the Vice President
denying that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions were not true and put Flynnin a potentially compromised position because the Russians would know he hadlied.'"* Yates disclosed that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI.'*° She declined to answera specific question about how Flynn
had performed during that interview,'*° but she indicated that Flynn's statements to the FBI were similar to the statements he had made to Pence and Spicer denying that he had discussed
sanctions.'47, McGahn came away from the meeting with the impression that the FBI had not pinned Flynn downin lies,'"* but he asked John Eisenberg, who served as legal advisor to the National Security Council, to examine potential legal issues raised by Flynn's FBI interview and
his contacts with Kislyak.'4°
That afternoon, McGahnnotified the President that Yates had come to the White House to discuss concerns about Flynn.!°° McGahn described what Yates had told him, and the President
asked him to repeatit, so he did.'*! MceGahnrecalled that whenhe described the FBI interview of
Flynn, he said that Flynn did not disclose having discussed sanctions with Kislyak, but that there

5. McGahnhas a Follow-Up Meeting About Flynn with Yates; President Trump has Dinner with FBI Director Comey
The next day, January 27, 2017, McGahn and Eisenberg discussed the results of Eisenberg's initial legal research into Flynn's conduct, and specifically whether Flynn may have
violated the Espionage Act, the Logan Act, or 18 U.S.C. § 1001.'° Based onhis preliminary
research, Eisenberg informed McGahnthat there was a possibility that Flynn had violated 18
U.S.C. § 1001 and the Logan Act.'*! Eisenberg notedthat the United States had neversuccessfully
prosecuted an individual under the Logan Act and that Flynn could have possible defenses, and

Analysis

In analyzing the President's conduct related to the Flynn investigation, the following evidenceis relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

a.

Obstructive act. According to Comey's accountof his February 14, 2017 meeting

in the Oval Office, the President told him, "I hope you can see your wayclearto letting this go, to

letting Flynn go. ... I hope youcan let this go." In analyzing whether these statements constitute

an obstructive act, a threshold question is whether Comey's accountof the interaction is accurate,

and, if so, whether the President's statements had the tendency to impede the administration of

justice by shutting down an inquiry that could result in a grand jury investigation and a criminal

charge.

After Comey's accountof the President's request to "let[] Flynn go" became public, the President publicly disputed several aspects of the story. The President told the New York Times that he did not "shoo other people out of the room" when hetalked to Comey and that he did not
rememberhaving a one-on-one conversation with Comey.The President also publicly denied
that he had asked Comeyto "let[] Flynn go" or otherwise communicated that Comey should drop
the investigation ofFlynn." In private, the President denied aspects of Comey's account to White
Houseadvisors, but acknowledged to Priebus that he brought Flynn up in the meeting with Comey and stated that Flynn was a good guy.""" Despite those denials, substantial evidence corroborates Comey's account.

266 @realDonaldTrump 3/31/17 (7:04 a.m. ET) Tweet; see Shane Harris at al., Mike Flynn Offers to Testify in Exchange for Immunity, Wall Street Journal (Mar. 30, 2017).
267 McFarland 12/22/17 302,at 18. 268 Excerpts From The Times's Interview With Trump, New York Times (July 19, 2017). Hicks recalled that the President told her he had never asked Comeyto stay behindin his office. Hicks 12/8/17 302, at 12. °° Tn a statement on May 16, 2017, the White House said: "While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man whoserved andprotected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comeyor anyoneelse to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn.... This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey." See Michael S. Schmidt, Comey Memorandum Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation, New York Times (May 16, 2017) (quoting White House statement); @realDonaldTrump 12/3/17 (6:15 a.m. ET) Tweet ("I never asked Comeyto stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comeylie!"). 2" Priebus recalled that the President acknowledgedtelling Comey that Flynn was a good guy and he hoped "everything worked out for him." Priebus 10/13/17 302, at 19. McGahn recalled that the President denied saying to Comey that he hoped Comey would let Flynn go, but addedthat he was "allowed to hope." The President told McGahnhe did not think he had crossed any lines. McGahn 12/14/17 302, at 8.

First, Comey wrote a detailed memorandum of his encounter with the President on the samedayit occurred. Comeyalsotold senior FBI officials about the meeting with the President that day, and their recollections of what Comey told them atthe time are consistent with Comey's
account.2"!
Second, Comey provided testimony about the President's request that he "let[] Flynn go" under oath in congressional proceedings and in interviews with federal investigators subject to penalties for lying under 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Comey's recollections of the encounter have remained consistent over time.
Third, the objective, corroborated circumstances of how the one-on-one meeting came to occur support Comey's description of the event. Comey recalled that the President cleared the room to speak with Comeyalone after a homeland security briefing in the Oval Office, that Kushnerand Sessionslingered and had to be shooed out bythe President, and that Priebusbriefly opened the door during the meeting, prompting the President to wave him away. While the President has publicly denied those details, other Administration officials who were present have confirmed Comey's account of how he ended up in a one-on-one meeting with the President." Andthe President acknowledged to Priebus and McGahnthat he in fact spoke to Comey about Flynnin their one-on-one meeting.
Fourth, the President's decision to clear the room and,in particular, to exclude the Attorney General from the meeting signals that the President wanted to be alone with Comey, which is consistent with the delivery of a message of the type that Comey recalls, rather than a more innocuousconversation that could have occurred in the presence of the Attorney General.
Finally, Comey's reaction to the President's statements is consistent with the President having asked him to "let[] Flynn go." Comey met with the FBI leadership team, which agreed to keep the President's statements closely held and not to inform the team working on the Flynn investigation so that they would not be influenced by the President's request. Comey also promptly met with the Attorney General to ask him notto be left alone with the President again, an account verified by Sessions, FBI Chief of Staff James Rybicki, and Jody Hunt, who wasthen the Attorney General's chief of staff.
A second question is whether the President's statements, which were not phrased as a direct order to Comey, could impede or interfere with the FBI's investigation of Flynn. While the Presidentsaid he "hope[d]" Comey could "let[] Flynn go," rather than affirmatively directing him to do so, the circumstancesof the conversation show thatthe President was asking Comey to close the FBI's investigation into Flynn. First, the President arranged the meeting with Comeysothat they would be alone and purposely excluded the Attorney General, which suggests that the President meant to make a request to Comey that he did not want anyone else to hear. Second, because the President is the head of the Executive Branch, when he says that he "hopes" a subordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the President wants. Indeed, the President repeated a version of"let this go" three times, and Comey

testified that he understood the President's statements as a directive, which is corroborated by the way Comeyreacted at the time.

b.

Nexusto a proceeding. To establish a nexusto a proceeding,it would be necessary

to show that the President could reasonably foresee and actually contemplated that the

investigation of Flynn waslikely to lead to a grand jury investigation or prosecution.

Atthe time of the President's one-on-one meeting with Comey, no grand jury subpoenas

had been issued aspart of the FBI's investigation into Flynn. But Flynn's lies to the FBI violated

federal criminal law,

, and resulted in Flynn's

prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001. By the time the President spoke to Comey about

Flynn, DOJ officials had informed McGahn, who informed the President, that Flynn's statements

to senior White House officials about his contacts with Kislyak were not true and that Flynn had told the same version of events to the FBI. McGahn also informed the President that Flynn's

conduct could violate 18 U.S.C. § 1001. After the Vice President and senior White Houseofficials reviewed the underlying information about Flynn's calls on February 10, 2017, they believed that

Flynn could not have forgotten his conversations with Kislyak and concluded that he had been

lying. In addition, the President's instruction to the FBI Director to "let[] Flynn go" suggests his

awareness that Flynn could face criminal exposure for his conduct and wasatrisk of prosecution.

c.

Intent. As part of our investigation, we examined whether the President had a

personal stake in the outcome of an investigation into Flyan--for example, whether the President

was aware of Flynn's communications with Kislyak close in time to when they occurred, such that

the President knew that Flynn hadlied to senior White Houseofficials and that those lies had been

passed onto the public. Some evidence suggests that the President knew about the existence and content of Flynn's calls when they occurred, but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be

relied uponto establish the President's knowledge. In advance of Flynn's initial call with Kislyak, the President attended a meeting where the sanctions were discussed and an advisor may have

mentioned that Flynn wasscheduled to talk to Kislyak. Flynn told McFarland about the substance

of his calls with Kislyak and said they may have made a difference in Russia's response, and Flynn

recalled talking to Bannonin early January 2017 about how they had successfully "stopped the

train on Russia's response" to the sanctions. It would have been reasonable for Flynn to have

wanted the President to know of his communications with Kislyak because Kislyak told Flynn his request had been received at the highest levels in Russia and that Russia had chosen notto retaliate

in response to the request, and the President was pleased by the Russian response, calling it a

"[g]reat move." And the President never said publicly or internally that Flynn hadlied to him

about the calls with Kislyak.

But McFarland did not recall providing the President-Elect with Flynn's read-out of his calls with Kislyak, and Flynn does not have a specific recollection oftelling the President-Elect directly about the calls. Bannon also said he did not recall hearing about the calls from Flynn. Andin February 2017, the President asked Flynn what wasdiscussed onthe calls and whetherhe had lied to the Vice President, suggesting that he did not already know. Our investigation accordingly did not produce evidence that established that the President knew about Flynn's discussions of sanctions before the Department of Justice notified the White House of those discussions in late January 2017. The evidence also does not establish that Flynn otherwise

possessedinformation damagingto the President that would give the Presidenta personal incentive to end the FBI's inquiry into Flynn's conduct.
Evidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI's broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told Christie, that terminating Flynn would end "the whole Russia thing." Flynn's firing occurred at a time when the media and Congress were raising questions about Russia's interference in the election and whether members of the President's campaign had colluded with Russia. Multiple witnesses recalled that the President viewed the Russia investigations as a challengeto the legitimacy of his election. The President paid careful attention to negative coverage of Flynn and reacted with annoyance and anger when the story broke disclosing that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Just hours before meeting one-on-one with Comey, the President told Christie that firing Flynn would put an endto the Russia inquiries. And after Christie pushed back,telling the Presidentthatfiring Flynn would not end the Russia investigation, the President asked Christie to reach out to Comey and convey that the Presidentliked him and he waspart of "the team." That afternoon, the President cleared the room and asked Comeyto "`let[] Flynn go."
Wealso sought evidence relevant to assessing whether the President's direction to Comey was motivated by sympathy towards Flynn. In public statements the President repeatedly described Flynn as a good person who had been harmed by the Russia investigation, and the President directed advisors to reach out to Flynn to tell him the President "care[d]" about him and felt bad for him. At the same time, multiple senior advisors, including Bannon, Priebus, and Hicks, said that the President had become unhappy with Flynn well before Flynn was forced to resign and that the President wasfrequently irritated with Flynn. Priebus said he believed the President's initial reluctance to fire Flynn stemmednotfrom personalregard, but from concern about the negative press that would be generated by firing the National Security Advisorso early in the Administration. And Priebus indicated that the President's post-firing expressions of support for Flynn were motivated by the President's desire to keep Flynn from saying negative things about him.
The way in which the President communicated the request to Comeyalso is relevant to understanding the President's intent. When the Presidentfirst learned about the FBIinvestigation into Flynn, he told McGahn, Bannon, and Priebusnotto discuss the matter with anyone else in the White House. The next day, the President invited Comey for a one-on-one dinner against the advice of an aide who recommendedthat other White Houseofficials also attend. At the dinner, the President asked Comeyfor "loyalty" and, at a different point in the conversation, mentioned that Flynn had judgment issues. When the President met with Comey the day after Flynn's termination--shortly after being told by Christie that firing Flynn would not end the Russia investigation--the President cleared the room, even excluding the Attorney General, so that he could again speak to Comey alone. The President's decision to meet one-on-one with Comey contravened the advice of the White House Counselthat the President should not communicate directly with the Departmentof Justice to avoid any appearanceofinterfering in law enforcement activities. And the Presidentlater denied that he cleared the room and asked Comeyto "let[] Flynn go"--adenial that would have been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

Finally, the President's effort to have McFarland write an internal email denying that the
President had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak highlights the President's concern aboutbeing associated with Flynn's conduct. The evidence doesnotestablish that the President
was trying to have McFarland lie. The President's request, however, was sufficiently irregular that McFarland--whodid not know the full extent of Flynn's communications with the President and thus could not makethe representation the President wanted--felt the need to draft an internal memorandum documenting the President's request, and Eisenberg was concerned that the request would look like a quid pro quo in exchange for an ambassadorship.

The President's Reaction to Public Confirmation of the FBI's Russia

Investigation

Overview

In early March 2017, the President learned that Sessions was considering recusing from the Russia investigation and tried to prevent the recusal. After Sessions announcedhis recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at Sessions for the decision and then privately asked Sessions to "unrecuse." On March 20, 2017, Comeypublicly disclosed the existence of the FBI's Russia investigation. In the days that followed, the President contacted Comey and other intelligence agency leaders and asked them to push back publicly on the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort in orderto "lift the cloud" of the ongoing investigation.

Evidence

1. Attorney General Sessions Recuses From the Russia Investigation

In late February 2017, the Departmentof Justice began an internal analysis of whether Sessions should recuse from the Russia investigation based on his role in the 2016 Trump Campaign.2" On March1, 2017, the press reportedthat, in his January confirmation hearing to become Attorney General, Senator Sessions had not disclosed two meetings he had with Russian Ambassador Kislyak before the presidential election, leading to congressional calls for Sessions to recuse or for a special counsel to investigate Russia's interference in the presidential election.?"

Also on March1, the President called Comey and said he wanted to check in and see how

Comey was doing"? According to an email Comeysentto his chief of staff after the call, the

President"talked about Sessionsa bit," said that he
that he hoped Comey would come by to say hello

had heard Comey was"doing great,"
when he was at the White House.""°

3. The President Asks Intelligence Community Leaders to Make Public Statements that he had No Connection to Russia

In the weeks following Comey's March 20, 2017 testimony, the President repeatedly asked intelligence community officials to push back publicly on any suggestion that the President had a connection to the Russian election-interference effort.

On March 22, 2017, the President asked Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and

CIA Director Michael Pompeo to stay behind in the Oval Office after a Presidential Daily

Briefing.**

Coats told this Office that the President never asked him to speak to Comey about the FBI investigation.°® Some ODNIstaffers, however, had a different recollection of how Coats described the meeting immediately after it occurred. According to senior ODNIofficial Michael Dempsey, Coats said after the meeting that the President had brought upthe Russia investigation and asked him to contact Comeyto see if there was a wayto get past the investigation, get it over with, end it, or words to that effect.?? Dempsey said that Coats described the President's comments as falling "somewhere between musing abouthating the investigation" and wanting Coats to "do something to stop it.4° Dempsey said Coats made it clear that he would not get involved with an ongoing FBI investigation"!

"I can't do anything with Russia, there's things I'd like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS,
they're all over me with this."°4* Coats told the Presidentthat the investigations were going to go on and the best thing to do was to let them run their course.>° Coats later testified in a congressional hearing that he had "neverfelt pressure to intervene or interfere in any way and shape--with shaping intelligence in a political way, or in relationship . . . to an ongoing

Analysis

In analyzing the President's reaction to Sessions's recusal and the requests he made to Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

a.

Obstructive act. The evidence shows that, after Comey's March 20, 2017

testimony, the President repeatedly reached outto intelligence agency leaders to discuss the FBI's investigation. But witnesses had different recollections ofthe precise content of those outreaches. Some ODNIofficials recalled that Coats told them immediately after the March 22 Oval Office meeting that the President asked Coats to intervene with Comey and "stop"the investigation. But the first-hand witnesses to the encounter remember the conversation differently. Pompeo had no memory of the specific meeting, but generally recalled the President urging officials to get the word out that the President had not done anything wrong related to Russia. Coats recalled that the President asked that Coatsstate publicly that no link existed between the President and Russia, but did not ask him to speak with Comeyorto help endthe investigation. The other outreaches by the President during this period were similar in nature. The President asked Rogers if he could do anything to refute the stories linking the President to Russia, and the President asked Comey to make a public statement that would "lift the cloud" of the ongoing investigation by making clear that the President was not personally underinvestigation. These requests, while significant enough that Rogers thought it important to documentthe encounter in a written memorandum, were not interpreted by the officials who received them as directives to improperly interfere with the

investigation.

b.

Nexusto a proceeding. At the time of the President's outreaches to leaders of the

intelligence agencies in late March and early April 2017, the FBI's Russia investigation did not

yet involve grand jury proceedings. The outreaches, however, cameafter and werein response to

Comey's March 20, 2017 announcementthat the FBI,as a part ofits counterintelligence mission,

was conducting an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Comeytestified that the investigation included any links or coordination with Trump campaign

officials and would "include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed."

c.

Intent. As described above, the evidence does notestablish that the President asked

or directed intelligence agency leadersto stop or interfere with the FBI's Russia investigation--

and the President affirmatively told Comey that if "some satellite" was involved in Russian election interference "it would be good to find that out." But the President's intent in trying to prevent Sessions's recusal, and in reaching out to Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comeyfollowing

60

U.S. Departmentof Justice WerkPrediet // Protected
Comey's public announcement of the FBI's Russia investigation, is nevertheless relevant to understanding what motivated the President's other actions towards the investigation.
The evidence shows that the President was focused on the Russia investigation's implications for his presidency--and,specifically, on dispelling any suggestion that he was under investigation or had links to Russia. In early March,the President attempted to prevent Sessions's recusal, even after being told that Sessions was following DOJ conflict-of-interest rules. After Sessions recused, the White House Counsel's Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions about the matter, althoughit is not clear whetherthat direction was conveyedto the President. The President continuedto raise the issue of Sessions's recusal and, when he had the opportunity, he pulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse. The Presidentalso told advisors that he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him, the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holderto haveprotectedtheir presidents. The President madestatements about beingable to direct the course of criminal investigations, saying wordsto the effect of, "You're telling me that Bobby and Jack didn't talk about investigations? Or Obamadidn't tell Eric Holder who to investigate?"
After Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the FBI's Russia investigation on March 20, 2017, the President was "beside himself' and expressed anger that Comey did not issue a statement correcting any misperception that the President himself was underinvestigation. The President sought to speak with Acting Attorney General Boente directly and told McGahn to contact Boente to request that Comey makea clarifying statement. The President then asked other intelligence community leaders to make public statements to refute the suggestion that the President had links to Russia, but the leaders told him they could not publicly comment on the investigation. On March 30 and April 11, against the advice of White House advisors who had informed him that any direct contact with the FBI could be perceived as improper interferencein an ongoinginvestigation, the President madepersonal outreaches to Comey asking him to "lift the cloud" of the Russia investigation by making public the fact that the President wasnot personally under investigation.
Evidence indicates that the President was angered by both the existence of the Russia investigation and the public reporting that he was underinvestigation, which he knew wasnottrue based on Comey's representations. The President complainedto advisors that if people thought Russia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had accomplished.
Other evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the Russia investigation on his ability to govern. The President complained that the perception that he was under investigation was hurting his ability to conduct foreign relations, particularly with Russia. The President told Coats he "can't do anything with Russia," he told Rogers that "the thing with the Russians" was interfering with his ability to conduct foreign affairs, and he told Comey that "he was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making thatdifficult."

Events Leading Up To and Surrounding the Termination of FBI Director

Comey

Overview

Comey was scheduled to testify before Congress on May 3, 2017. Leading up to that testimony, the President continuedto tell advisors that he wanted Comey to make public that the President was not underinvestigation. At the hearing, Comey declined to answer questions about the scope or subjects of the Russia investigation and did not state publicly that the President was not under investigation. Two days later, on May 5, 2017, the President told close aides he was going to fire Comey, and on May9, he did so, using his official termination letter to make public that Comey had on three occasions informed the President that he was not underinvestigation. The President decided to fire Comey before receiving advice or a recommendation from the DepartmentofJustice, but he approvedan initial public account of the termination that attributed it to a recommendation from the Departmentof Justice based on Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation. After Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resisted attributing the firing to his recommendation, the President acknowledgedthat he intended to fire Comey regardless of the DOJ recommendation and wasthinking of the Russia investigation when he madethe decision. The Presidentalso told the Russian Foreign Minister, "I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off..... I'm not under investigation."

2. The President Makes the Decision to Terminate Comey

The weekend following Comey's May 3, 2017 testimony, the President traveled to his

resort in Bedminster, New Jersey." Ata dinner on Friday, May 5, attended by the President and

various advisors and family members, including Jared Kushner and senior advisor Stephen Miller,

the President stated that he wanted to remove Comeyandhadideasfora letter that would be used to make the announcement.' The President dictated arguments and specific language for the

letter, and Miller took notes.*°° As reflected in the notes, the President told Miller that the letter should start, "While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation

concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russiarelationship --

pertaining to the 2016
public -- including Ds

presidential election, please be
and Rs -- havelostfaith in you

informedthat I, and I believe the American
as Director of the FBI." Following the

dinner, Miller prepared a termination letter based on those notes and research he conducted to

support the President's arguments.*°" Over the weekend, the President provided several rounds of

White House what they were preparing because the President was worried about leaks.4° In his discussions with Miller, the President made clear that he wanted the letter to open
with a reference to him not being under investigation.*'° Miller said he believed that fact was
important to the President to show that Comey was not being terminated based on any such
investigation.*!! According to Miller, the President wanted to establish as a factual matter that
Comey had been undera "review period" and did not have assurance from the Presidentthat he
would be permitted to keep his job." The final version of the termination letter prepared by Miller and the President began in a
way that closely tracked whatthe President had dictated to Miller at the May 5 dinner: "Dear Director Comey, While I greatly appreciate your informing me, on three separate occasions, thatI am not under investigation concerning the fabricated and politically-motivated allegations of a Trump-Russiarelationship with respect to the 2016 Presidential Election, please be informed that I, along with members of both political parties and, most importantly, the American Public, have lost faith in youas the Director of the FBI and you are hereby terminated."*'? The four-pageletter went on to critique Comey's judgment and conduct, including his May 3 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his handling ofthe Clinton email investigation, andhis failure to hold
leakers accountable.4!* The letter stated that Comey had "asked [the President] at dinner shortly
after inauguration to let [Comey] stay on in the Director's role, and [the President] said that [he] would considerit," but the President had "concluded that [he] ha[d] no alternative but to find new leadership for the Bureau -- leader that restores confidence andtrust.'*!°

President's decision to terminate Comey was driven by the recommendations the President
received from Rosenstein and Sessions.*"
In the morning on May 10, 2017, President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office.8 The media subsequently reported that during the May 10 meeting the President brought up his decision the prior day to terminate Comey,telling Lavrov and Kislyak: "T just fired the head of the F.B.I. He wascrazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.... I'm not
underinvestigation."*© The President never denied making those statements, and the White House
did not dispute the account, instead issuing a statement that said: "By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on ourability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified information."*"° Hicks said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with
Lavrov, he did not look concerned andsaid of Comey,"he is crazy."*"! When McGahn asked the
President about his comments to Lavrov, the President said it was good that Comey wasfired because that took the pressure off by makingit clear that he was not underinvestigation so he
could get more work done.*" That same morning, on May 10, 2017, the President called McCabe.` According to a

should not have been permitted to travel back to Washington, D.C. on the FBI's airplane after he had been terminated and that he did not want Comey "`in the building again," even to collect his belongings." When McCabe met with the President that afternoon, the President, without prompting, told McCabe that people in the FBI loved the President, estimated that at least 80% of the FBI had voted for him, and asked McCabe who he had voted for in the 2016 presidential
election.4""
In the afternoon of May 10, 2017, deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders spoke to the President about his decision to fire Comey and then spoke to reporters in a televised press
conference.*"8 Sanders told reporters that the President, the Department ofJustice, and bipartisan
members of Congress had lost confidence in Comey, "[a]nd most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director. Accordingly, the President accepted the
recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Comey from his position.'"*""
In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided "on his own" to review Comey's performance and that Rosenstein decided "on his own" to come to the President on Monday, May8 to express his concerns about Comey. When a reporter indicated that the "vast majority" of FBI agents supported Comey, Sanders said, "Look, we've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things.'"®° Following the press conference, Sanders spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job anddid not point out any inaccuracies in her comments.*®! Sanderstold this Office that her reference to hearing from "countless members of the FBI" was a "slip of the tongue.""*? Shealso recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made
"in the heat of the moment" that was not founded on anything.**

the Departmentof Justice had initiated Comey's termination,** and McGahn asked attorneys in
the White House Counsel's Office to work with the press office to correct the narrative.**
The next day, on May 11, 2017, the Presidentparticipated in an interview with Lester Holt. The President told White House Counsel's Office attorneys in advance of the interview that the communications team could not get the story right, so he was going on Lester Holt to say what really happened.*®" During the interview,the Presidentstated that he had madethe decisionto fire Comeybefore the President met with Rosenstein and Sessions. The President told Holt, "I was going to fire regardless of recommendation .... [Rosenstein] made a recommendation. But regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no goodtimeto do it.'488 The President continued, "And in fact, whenI decidedto just doit, I said to myself--Isaid, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the
Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
In response to a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia investigation, the President said, "As far as I'm concerned,I wantthat thing to be absolutely done properly.'°° The President addedthathe realized his termination of Comey "probably maybewill confuse people" with the result that it "might even lengthen out the investigation," but he "ha[d] to do the right thing for the American people" and Comey was"the wrong manforthat position.'"4?!

President affirmedthat he expected the new FBIdirector to continue the Russia investigation.""?
On the evening of May 11, 2017, following the Lester Holt interview, the President tweeted, "Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.'"4°* The same day, the media reported that the President had demanded that Comeypledge his loyalty to the President in a private dinner shortly

James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there

Analysis

In analyzing the President's decision to fire Comey,the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction ofjustice:

a.

Obstructive act. The act of firing Comey removed the individual overseeing the

FBI's Russia investigation. The President knew that Comey was personally involved in the

investigation based on Comey's briefing of the Gang of Eight, Comey's March 20, 2017 public

testimony aboutthe investigation, and the President's one-on-one conversations with Comey.

Firing Comey would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect ofinterfering with or impeding the investigation--for example,if the termination would have the effect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the President with the opportunity to appoint a director who wouldtake a different approach to the investigation that the President perceived as moreprotective of his personalinterests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that issue include whetherthe President's actions had the potential to discourage a successordirector or other law enforcementofficials in their conduct of the Russia investigation. The Presidentfired Comey abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building, and criticized him publicly, calling him a "showboat"and claiming that the FBI was "in turmoil" underhis leadership. And the President followed the termination with public statements that were highly critical of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Comey, the President
referred to the investigation as a "witch hunt" and asked, "when doesit end?" Those actions had
the potential to affect a successor director's conductof the investigation.

The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation. As a general matter, FBI investigations run underthe operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director.
Bannon made a similar point when he told the President that he could fire the FBI director, but
could notfire the FBI. The White House issued a press statement the day after Comey wasfired that said, "The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have endedit." In addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the Presidentstated that he understood when he madethe decision to fire Comey that the action might prolong the investigation. And the President chose McCabe to serve as interim director, even

though McCabetold the President he had worked "very closely" with Comey and waspartof all the decisions made in the Clinton investigation.

b. Nexus to a proceeding. The nexus element would be satisfied by evidence showing that a grand jury proceeding or criminal prosecution arising from an FBI investigation was objectively foreseeable and actually contemplated by the President when he terminated Comey.

Several facts wouldbe relevant to such a showing. Atthe time the Presidentfired Comey, a grand jury had not begun to hear evidencerelated to the Russia investigation and no grand jury subpoenas had been issued. On March 20, 2017, however, Comey had announced that the FBI wasinvestigating Russia's interference in the election, including "an assessment of whether any crimes were committed." It was widely knownthat the FBI, as part of the Russia investigation, wasinvestigating the hacking of the DNC's computers--aclear criminal offense.

In addition, at the time the President fired Comey, evidence indicates the President knew that Flynn wasstill under criminal investigation and could potentially be prosecuted, despite the President's February 14, 2017 request that Comey "let[] Flynn go." On March 5, 2017, the White House Counsel's Office was informed that the FBI was asking for transition-period records relating to Flynn--indicating that the FBI wasstill actively investigating him. The same day, the President told advisors he wanted to call Dana Boente, then the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation, to find out whether the White House or the President was being investigated. On March 31, 2017, the President signaled his awareness that Flynn remainedin legal jeopardy by tweeting that "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity" before he agreed to provide testimonyto the FBI or Congress. And in late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a message to Flynn telling him that the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong, further demonstrating the President's awareness of Flynn's criminal exposure.

c.

Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President's decision

to fire Comey was Comey's unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally

under investigation, despite the President's repeated requests that Comey make such an

announcement. In the week leading up to Comey's May 3, 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee

testimony, the President told McGahnthatit wouldbe the last straw if Comey did notset the record

straight and publicly announcethat the President wasnot under investigation. But during his May

3 testimony, Comey refused to answer questions about whether the President was being

investigated. Comey's refusal angered the President, who criticized Sessions for leaving him

isolated and exposed, saying "You left me on an island." Two days later, the President told

advisors he had decided to fire Comey and dictated a letter to Stephen Miller that began with a

reference to the fact that the President wasnot being investigated: "While I greatly appreciate you

informing me that I am notunder investigation concerning whatI have often stated is a fabricated

story on a Trump-Russia relationship ...." The President later asked Rosenstein to include

"Russia" in his memorandum and to say that Comeyhadtold the President that he was not under

investigation. And the President's final termination letter included a sentence, at the President's

insistence and against McGahn's advice, stating that Comey had told the President on three

separate occasions that he was not underinvestigation.

The President's other stated rationales for why he fired Comeyare not similarly supported by the evidence. Thetermination letter the President and Stephen Miller prepared in Bedminster

75

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WorkPreduet // PrMay-Conti et Materil eete Fed: R-Cd rim- - P-
cited Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the President told McCabe he fired Comey for that reason. But the facts surrounding Comey's handling of the Clinton email
investigation were well knownto the President at the time he assumedoffice, and the President
had madeit clear to both Comey and the President's senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted
Comeyto stay on as director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Comey's handling of the
Clinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Comey. The President's draft termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI wasat an all-time low and Sanderstold the press after Comey's termination that the White House had heard from "countless" FBI agents who had lost confidence in Comey. Butthe evidence does not support those claims. The President told Comeyat their January 27 dinner that "the people of the FBI really like [him]," no evidence suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Comey, and Sanders
acknowledgedto investigators that her comments were not founded on anything.
Wealso considered why it was important to the President that Comey announcepublicly that he was not under investigation. Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia. The President told Comey that the "cloud" of "this Russia business" was makingit difficult to run the country. The President told Sessions and McGahnthat foreign leaders had expressed sympathyto him for being underinvestigation and that the perception he wasunderinvestigation washurtinghis ability to address foreign relationsissues. The President complained to Rogers that "the thing with the Russians [was] messing up" his ability to get things done with Russia, and told Coats, "I can't do anything with Russia,there's things I'd like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they're all over me with this." The President also may have viewed Comeyasinsubordinate for his failure to makeclear in the May 3 testimony that the President wasnot under investigation.
Other evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into his campaign. The day after learning about the FBI's interview of Flynn, the President had a one-on-one dinner with Comey,against the advice ofsenior aides, and told Comey he needed Comey's "loyalty." When the President later asked Comey for a second time to make public that he was not underinvestigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying "Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know." After the President learned of Sessions's recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents. The Presidentalso said he wantedto beabletotell his Attorney General"whoto investigate."
In addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI's Russia investigation behind him. The evidence does not establish that the termination of Comey was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in VolumeI, the evidence uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understoodto be crimesor that would give rise to personaland political concerns. Although the President publicly stated during and after the election that he had no connection to Russia, the Trump Organization, through Michael Cohen,

at a time when public reports stated that Russianintelligence officials were behind the

hacks, and that Trump privately sought information about future WikiLeaks releases."? More

broadly, multiple witnesses described the President's preoccupation with press coverage of the

Russia investigation and his persistent concern thatit raised questions aboutthe legitimacy of his

election?

Finally, the President and White Houseaidesinitially advanced a pretextual reasonto the
press and the public for Comey's termination. In the immediate aftermath of the firing, the President dictated a press statement suggesting that he had acted based on the DOJ recommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story. But the President had decided to fire Comey before the White House solicited those recommendations. Although the
President ultimately acknowledged that he wasgoing to fire Comey regardless of the Department
of Justice's recommendations, he did so only after DOJ officials madeclear to him that they would resist the White House's suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Comey's
termination. The initial reliance on a pretextualjustification could support an inference that the President had concerns about providingthe real reason forthe firing, although the evidence does
not resolve whether those concerns were personal, political, or both.

E.

The President's Efforts to Remove the Special Counsel

Overview

The Acting Attorney General appointed a Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, prompting
the Presidentto state that it was the end of his presidency and that Attorney General Sessions had failed to protect him and should resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, which the President
ultimately did not accept. The Presidenttold senior advisors that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest, but they respondedthat those claims were "ridiculous" and posed no obstacle to the
Special Counsel's service. Department of Justice ethics officials similarly cleared the Special
Counsel's service. On June 14, 2017, the press reported that the President was being personally investigated for obstruction of justice and the President responded with a series of tweets

48 See VolumeII, Section II.K.1, infra.

499 See Volume I, Section III.D.1, supra.

50 Th addition to whether the President had a motive related to Russia-related matters that an FBI

investigation could uncover, we considered whetherthe President's intentin firing Comey was connected

to other conduct that could come to light as a result of the FBI's Russian-interference investigation. In

particular, Michael Cohen wasa potential subject of investigation because of his pursuit of the Trump

Tower Moscow project investigation, which our

and involvement in Office referred to the

other activities. And facts uncovered in the Russia U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New

York,ultimately led to the conviction of Cohen in the Southern District of New York for campaign-finance

offenses related to payments he said he madeatthe direction of the President. See VolumeII, Section

ILK.5, infra. The investigation, however, did not establish considering the possibility that the FBI's investigation would

criticizing the Special Counsel's investigation. That weekend, the President called McGahn and directed him to have the Special Counsel removed because of asserted conflicts of interest. McGahn did not carry out the instruction for fear of being seen as triggering another Saturday Night Massacre and instead prepared to resign. McGahn ultimately did not quit and the President did not follow up with McGahnonhis request to have the Special Counsel removed.

investigation, chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel, or otherwise impede the investigation.
A threshold question is whether the President in fact directed McGahnto have the Special Counsel removed. After newsorganizations reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered
McGahnto have the Special Counsel removed,the President publicly disputed these accounts, and
privately told McGahnthat he had simply wanted McGahn to bring conflicts of interest to the Department of Justice's attention. See VolumeII, Section III, infra. Some of the President's
specific language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with that explanation.
Substantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President wentfurther andin fact
directed McGahnto call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed.
First, McGahn's clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein
not only that conflicts existed but also that "Mueller has to go." McGahnis a credible witness
with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.®! McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, makingit unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President's request. In response to that request, McGahndecided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin to the Saturday Night Massacre. He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packeduphis
office, prepared to submita resignation letter with his chiefofstaff, told Pricbus that the President
had asked him to "do crazy shit," and informed Priebus and Bannon that he was leaving. Those acts would be a highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Departmentof Justice.
Second, in the days before the calls to McGahn,the President, through his counsel, had already broughtthe asserted conflicts to the attention of the Departmentof Justice. Accordingly, the President had no reason to have McGahncall Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues that already had beenraised.
Third, the President's sense of urgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take immediate action on a weekend--*Yougotta do this. You gotta call Rod."--support McGahn's recollection that the President wanted the Departmentof Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel. Had the President instead sought only to have the Department of Justice re-examine asserted
conflicts to evaluate whether they posed an ethicalbar, it would have been unnecessary to set the
process in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated calls to McGahn.
Finally, the President had discussed "knocking out Mueller"and raised conflicts of interest in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn,reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan to remove the Special Counsel. And in the days leading up to June 17, 2017, the President made clear to Priebus and Bannon, whothen told Ruddy,that the President was considering terminating
691 When this Office first interviewed McGahnabout this topic, he was reluctant to share detailed information about what had occurred and only did so after continued questioning. See McGahn 12/14/17 302 (agent notes).

the Special Counsel. Also during this time period, the President reached out to Christie to get his thoughts on firing the Special Counsel. This evidence showsthatthe President wasnotjust seeking an examination of whetherconflicts existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a wayto terminate the Special Counsel.

b.

Nexus to an official proceeding. To satisfy the proceeding requirement, it would

be necessary to establish a nexus between the President's act of seeking to terminate the Special

Counsel and a pendingor foreseeable grandjury proceeding.

Substantial evidence indicates that by June 17, 2017, the President knew his conduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of federal crimes to a grand jury. On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly warned the President that his "biggest exposure"
wasnot his act of firing Comey but his "other contacts" and "calls," and his "ask re: Flynn." By early June, it was widely reported in the media that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas in the Flynn inquiry and that the Special Counsel had taken over the Flynn investigation.On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel's Office informed the White House that investigators would be interviewing intelligence agencyofficials who allegedly had been asked by the Presidentto push back against the Russia investigation. On June 14, 2017, newsoutlets began reporting that the President was himself being investigated for obstruction of justice. Based on widespreadreporting, the President knew that such an investigation could include his request for Comey's loyalty; his request that Comey "let[] Flynn go"; his outreach to Coats and Rogers; and his termination of Comey and statement to the Russian Foreign Minister that the termination had relieved "great pressure" related to Russia. And on June 16, 2017, the day before he directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly acknowledged that his conduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor, tweeting, "I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man whotold meto fire the FBI Director!"

c.

Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the President's attempts to remove the

Special Counselwerelinked to the Special Counsel's oversight of investigations that involved the

President's conduct--and, most immediately, to reports that the President was being investigated

for potential obstruction ofjustice.

Before the President terminated Comey,the President consideredit critically important that he was not underinvestigation and that the public not erroneously think he was being investigated.
As described in Volume II, Section II.D, supra, advisors perceived the President, while he was drafting the Comey terminationletter, to be concerned more than anything else aboutgetting out that he wasnot personally underinvestigation. When the President learned of the appointment of the Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed further concern aboutthe investigation, saying "Tt]his is the end of my Presidency." The Presidentalso faulted Sessions for recusing, saying "you were supposed to protect me."

On June 14, 2017, when the Washington Post reported that the Special Counsel was investigating the President for obstruction of justice, the President was facing what he had wanted

62 See, e.g., Evan Perez et al., CNN exclusive: Grand jury subpoenas issued in FBI's Russia investigation, CNN (May9, 2017); Matt Ford, Why Mueller Is Taking Over the Michael Flynn GrandJury, The Atlantic (June 2, 2017).

to avoid: a criminal investigation into his own conduct that was the subject of widespread media attention. The evidenceindicates that newsof the obstruction investigation prompted the President
to call McGahn andseek to have the Special Counsel removed. By mid-June, the Departmentof
Justice had already cleared the Special Counsel's service and the President's advisors had told him that the claimed conflicts of interest were"silly" and did not provide a basis to remove the Special Counsel. On June 13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before Congress that no good cause for removing the Special Counsel existed, and the President dictated a press statement to Sanders saying he had nointention of firing the Special Counsel. But the next day, the media reported that the President was under investigation for obstruction of justice and the Special Counsel was interviewing witnesses about events related to possible obstruction--spurring the
President to write critical tweets about the Special Counsel's investigation. The President called
McGahn at home that night and then called him on Saturday from Camp David. The evidence
accordingly indicates that news that an obstruction investigation had been opened is whatled the President to call McGahnto have the Special Counsel terminated.

Therealso is evidence that the President knew that he should not have made thosecalls to McGahn. The President made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told the President that the White House Counsel's Office--and McGahn himself--could not be involved in pressing conflicts claims and that the President should consult with his personal counsel if he wishedto raise conflicts. Instead of relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts claims, the President soughtto usehis official powers to remove the Special Counsel. And after the media reported on the President's actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story, as discussed in Volume II, Section ILI, infra. Those denials are contrary to the evidence and suggest the President's awarenessthat the direction to McGahn couldbe seen as improper.

F.

The President's Efforts to Curtail the Special Counsel Investigation

Overview

Two days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attemptto affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowskiin the Oval Office and dictated a message to be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have hadthe effect of limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference only. One monthlater, the President met again with Lewandowski and followed up on the request to have Sessions limit the scope of the Russia investigation. Lewandowski told the President the message would be delivered soon. Hourslater, the Presidentpublicly criticized Sessions in an unplannedpress interview, raising questions about Sessions's job security.

1. The President Asks Corey Lewandowski to Deliver a Message to Sessions to Curtail the Special Counsel Investigation

On June 19, 2017, two days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign

manager Corey Lewandowski. Senior White House advisors described Lewandowski as a "devotee" of the President and said the relationship between the President and Lewandowski was
"close,

During the June 19 meeting, Lewandowski recalled

investigation.The

President told Lewandowski that Sessions was weak and that if the President had knownabout the

likelihood of recusal in advance, he would

not have

appointed Sessions.°® The President then
andsaid "write this down."°" This wasthe

first time the President had asked Lewandowski to take dictation, and Lewandowski wroteas fast

as possible to make sure he captured the contentcorrectly.°

The President directed that Sessions should give a speech publicly announcing:

I knowthat I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas. But our POTUS. .. is being treated very unfairly. He shouldn't have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel b/c he hasn't done anything wrong. I was on the campaign w/ him for nine months, there
were no Russians involved with him. I know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn't do
anything wrong excepthe ran the greatest campaign in American history.

The dictated message went on to state that Sessions would meet with the Special Counsel to limit his jurisdiction to future election interference:
Now a group of people wantto subvert the Constitution of the United States. I am going to meet with the Special Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special
Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that
nothing can happenin future elections.°'

Lewandowski wanted to pass the message to Sessions in person rather than over the phone.°'? He did not want to meetat the Departmentof Justice because he did not want a public

2. The President Follows Up with Lewandowski

Following his June meeting with the President, Lewandowski contacted Rick Dearborn, then a senior White Houseofficial, and asked if Dearborn could pass a message to Sessions.`'® Dearborn agreed without knowing what the message was, and Lewandowskilater confirmed that Dearborn would meet with Sessionsfor dinnerin late July and could deliver the message then.°! Lewandowski recalled thinking that the President had asked him to pass the message because the President knew Lewandowski could betrusted, but Lewandowski believed Dearborn would be a better messenger because he had a longstandingrelationship with Sessions and because Dearborn was in the government while Lewandowski was not."

OnJuly 19, 2017, the President again met with Lewandowskialonein the Oval Office.*!
In the preceding days, as described in Volume II, Section II.G, infra, emails and other information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between several Russians and Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort had been publicly disclosed. In the July 19 meeting with Lewandowski, the

Immediately following the meeting with the President, Lewandowski saw Dearbornin the anteroom outside the Oval Office and gave him a typewritten version of the messagethe President
had dictated to be delivered to Sessions.°° Lewandowski told Dearborn that the notes were the
messagethey had discussed, but Dearborn did not recall whether Lewandowski said the message was from the President.The message "definitely raised an eyebrow" for Dearborn, and he
recalled not wanting to ask where it came from orthink further about doing anything withit."
Dearborn also said that being asked to serve as a messenger to Sessions made him
uncomfortable.® He recalled later telling Lewandowski that he had handled the situation, but he did not actually follow through with delivering the message to Sessions, and he did not keep a copyofthe typewritten notes Lewandowski had given him."
3. The President Publicly Criticizes Sessions ina New York Times Interview Within hours of the President's meeting with Lewandowskion July 19, 2017, the President gave an unplanned interview to the New York Timesin which hecriticized Sessions's decision to recuse from the Russia investigation."° The President said that "Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he tookthe

Analysis

In analyzing the President's efforts to have Lewandowski deliver a message directing Sessions to publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future election interference, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction ofjustice:

a.

Obstructive act. The President's effort to send Sessions a message through

Lewandowski would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the investigation

and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.

The President sought to have Sessions announce that the President "shouldn't have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel" and that Sessions was going to "meet with the Special Prosecutorto explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happenin future elections." The President wanted Sessions to disregard his recusal from the investigation, which had followed from a formal DOJ ethics review, and have Sessions declare that he knew "for a fact" that "there were no Russians
involved with the campaign" becausehe "was there." The President further directed that Sessions
should explain that the President should not be subjectto an investigation "because he hasn't done anything wrong." Taken together, the President's directives indicate that Sessions was being instructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the existing investigation into the President and his campaign, with the Special Counsel being permitted to "move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections."

b.

Nexusto an official proceeding. As described above, by the time of the President's

initial one-on-one meeting with Lewandowski on June 19, 2017, the existence of a grand jury
investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. By the time of the

President's follow-up meeting with Lewandowski,

See Volume II, Section II.G, infra. To satisfy the nexus requirement, it would be necessary to show that limiting the Special Counsel's investigation would have the natural and probable effect of impeding that grand jury proceeding.

c.

Intent. Substantial evidenceindicates that the President's effort to have Sessions

limit the scope of the Special Counsel's investigation to future election interference was intended

to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President's and his campaign's conduct.

As previously described, see Volume II, Section II.B, supra, the President knew that the Russia investigation was focused in part on his campaign, and he perceived allegations of Russian interference to cast doubton the legitimacy of his election. The President further knew that the
investigation had broadened to include his own conduct and whether he hadobstructed justice.
Thoseinvestigations would not proceed if the Special Counsel's jurisdiction werelimited to future election interference only.

The timing and circumstancesof the President's actions support the conclusion that he
soughtthat result. The President's initial direction that Sessions should limit the Special Counsel's
investigation came just two days after the President had ordered McGahn to have the Special
Counsel removed, whichitself followed public reports that the President was personally under

97

U.S. Department of Justice Attorney-WorkPreduet // Protected
investigation for obstruction of justice. The sequenceofthose eventsraises an inferencethat after seeking to terminate the Special Counsel, the President sought to exclude his and his campaign's conduct from the investigation's scope. The President raised the matter with Lewandowskiagain on July 19, 2017, just days after emails and information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between Russians and senior campaignofficials had been publicly disclosed, generating substantial media coverage and investigative interest.
The manner in which the President acted provides additional evidence ofhis intent. Rather than rely on official channels, the President met with Lewandowskialonein the Oval Office. The
President selected a loyal "devotee" outside the White House to deliver the message, supporting an inference that he was working outside White House channels, including McGahn, who had previously resisted contacting the Department of Justice about the Special Counsel. The President also did not contact the Acting Attorney General, whohad justtestified publicly that there was no cause to remove the Special Counsel. Instead, the Presidenttried to use Sessionsto restrict and
redirect the Special Counsel's investigation when Sessions was recused and could not properly
take any action on it. The July 19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the President's intent. The President
followed up with Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one monthafterhefirst dictated
the message for Sessions, demonstrating he still sought to pursue the request. And just hours after Lewandowski assured the President that the message would soon be delivered to Sessions, the President gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he publicly attacked Sessions and raised questions about his job security. Four days later, on July 22, 2017, the President directed Priebusto obtain Sessions's resignation. That evidence could raise an inference
that the President wanted Sessionsto realize that his job might be on the line as he evaluated whether to comply with the President's direction that Sessions publicly announce that,
notwithstanding his recusal, he was goingto confine the Special Counsel's investigation to future election interference.
G. The President's Efforts to Prevent Disclosure of Emails About the June 9, 2016 Meeting Between Russians and Senior Campaign Officials Overview
By June 2017, the President became aware of emails setting up the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians who offered derogatory information on Hillary Clinton as "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump." On multiple occasions in late June and early July 2017, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails, and he then dictated a statement about the meeting to be issued by Donald TrumpJr. describing the meeting as about adoption.
Evidence 1. The President Learns About the Existence of Emails Concerning the June 9
2016 Trump Tower Meeting In mid-June 2017--the same weekthat the Presidentfirst asked Lewandowski to pass a message to Sessions--senior Administration officials became aware of emails exchanged during

the campaign arranging a meeting between Donald TrumpJr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and a Russian attorney." As described in VolumeI, Section IV.A.5, supra, the emails stated that the "Crown [P]rosecutor of Russia" had offered "to provide the Trump campaign with someofficial documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia"as part
of "Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."°* TrumpJr. responded,"[I]f it's what you say I loveit,"°® and he, Kushner, and Manafort met with the Russian attorney and several other Russian individuals at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016.% At the meeting, the Russian attorney
claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, and the Russian attorney then spoke about the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. statute that imposedfinancial andtravel sanctions on Russianofficials and that had resultedin a retaliatory
ban in Russia on U.S. adoptionsof Russian children.°

According to written answers submitted by the President in response to questions from this Office, the President had norecollection of learning of the meeting or the emails setting it up at the
time the meeting occurred or at any othertime before the election.°

The Trump Campaign had previously received a documentrequest from SSCTthat called

for the production of various information, including, "[a] list and a description of all meetings" between any "individual affiliated with the Trump campaign" and "any individual formally or

being shocked by the emails because they looked "really bad."°*!

Analysis

In analyzing the President's actions regarding the disclosure of information aboutthe June 9 meeting, the following evidenceis relevantto the elements ofobstruction ofjustice:

a.

Obstructive act. On at least three occasions between June 29, 2017, and July 9,

2017, the President directed Hicks and others not to publicly disclose information about the June

9 See, e.g., David Wright, Trump lawyer: President was aware of "nothing", CNN (July 12, 2017) (quoting the President's personal attorney as saying, "I wasn't involved in the statementdrafting at all nor was the President."); see also Good Morning America, ABC (July 12, 2017) ("The President didn't sign off on anything. . .. The President wasn't involvedin that."); Meet the Press, NBC (July 16, 2017) ("I do want to be clear--the President was not involved in the drafting of the statement.").

9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian attorney. On June 29, Hicks warned the President that the emails setting up the June 9 meeting were"really bad" and the story would be "massive" when it broke, but the President told her and Kushnerto "leave it alone." Early on July 8, after Hicks told the President the New York Times was working on a story about the June 9 meeting, the President directed her not to comment, even though Hicks said that the
President usually considered not respondingto the press to be the ultimate sin. Later that day, the
Presidentrejected Trump Jr.'s draft statement that would have acknowledgedthat the meeting was with "an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign." The President then dictated a statement to Hicks that said the meeting was about Russian adoption (which the President had twice been told was discussed at the meeting). The statement dictated
by the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton.

Eachof these efforts by the President involved his communications team and was directed at the press. They would amountto obstructive acts only if the President, by taking these actions, soughtto withhold information from or mislead congressionalinvestigators or the Special Counsel. On May 17, 2017, the President's campaign received a document request from SSCIthat clearly covered the June 9 meeting and underlying emails, and those documents also plainly would have beenrelevantto the Special Counsel's investigation.

But the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails or other information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the Special Counsel. The series of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to the emails and preventtheir public release occurred in the context of developing a press strategy. The only evidence we have of the President discussing the production of documents to Congress or the Special Counsel is the conversation on June 29, 2017, when Hicks recalled the President acknowledging that Kushner's attorney should provide emails related to the June 9 meeting to whomever he needed to give them to. We do not have evidence of what the President discussed with his own lawyersat that time.

bs

Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by the time ofthe President's

attempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting, the existence of

a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge, and the

President had been told that the emails were responsive to congressional inquiries. To satisfy the

nexus requirement, however, it would be necessary to showthat preventing the release of the

emails to the public would have the natural and probable effect of impeding the grand jury

proceeding or congressional inquiries. As noted above, the evidence does notestablish that the

President sought to prevent disclosure of the emails in those official proceedings.

c.

Intent. The evidence establishes the President's substantial involvementin the

communications strategy related to information about his campaign's connections to Russia and

his desire to minimize public disclosures about those connections. The President became aware

of the emails no later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them with Hicks and Kushner, and

he could have been aware of them as early as June 2, 2017, when lawyers for the Trump

Organization began interviewing witnesses whoparticipated in the June 9 meeting. The President

thereafter repeatedly rejected the advice of Hicks andotherstaffers to publicly release information
about the June 9 meeting. The President expressed concern that multiple people had accessto the

emails and instructed Hicks that only one lawyer should deal with the matter. And the President

dictated a statement to be released by TrumpJr. in response to thefirst press accounts of the June
9 meetingthat said the meeting was aboutadoption.

But as described above, the evidence does not establish that the President intended to prevent the Special Counsel's Office or Congress from obtaining the emails setting up the June 9 meeting or other information about that meeting. The statement recorded by Corallo--that the emails "will never get out"--can be explained asreflecting a belief that the emails would not be made public if the President's press strategy were followed, even if the emails were provided to Congress and the Special Counsel.

The President's Further Efforts to Have the Attorney General Take Overthe

Investigation

Overview

From summer 2017 through 2018, the President attempted to have Attorney General Sessions reverse his recusal, take control of the Special Counsel's investigation, and order an investigation of Hillary Clinton.

Evidence

1. The President Again Seeks to Have Sessions Reverse his Recusal

After returning Sessions's resignation letter at the end of May 2017, but before the President's July 19, 2017 New York Times interview in whichhepublicly criticized Sessions for recusing from the Russia investigation, the President took additional steps to have Sessions reverse his recusal. In particular, at somepointafter the May 17, 2017 appointmentofthe Special Counsel, Sessions recalled, the President called him at home and asked if Sessions would "unrecuse" himself."2° According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions could direct the Departmentof Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the "gist" of the conversation was that the President wanted Sessions to unrecuse from "allofit," including the Special Counsel's Russia investigation.' Sessions listened but did not respond, and he did not reverse his recusal or order an investigation of Clinton."*

to be Attorney General one day."! Because Porter knew Brand, the President asked him to sound her out about taking responsibility for the investigation and being Attorney General."? Contemporaneous notes taken by Porter show thatthe President told Porterto "Keep in touch with
yourfriend," in reference to Brand." Later, the President asked Porter a few times in passing
whetherhe had spokento Brand, but Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable with the task.""4 In asking him to reach out to Brand, Porter understood the President to want to find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the Special Counsel, although the President
never said so explicitly.° Porter did not contact Brand because he wassensitive to the
implications of that action and did not wantto be involvedin a chain of events associated with an
effort to end the investigation orfire the Special Counsel."4°
McGahn recalled that during the summer of 2017, he and the President discussed the fact that if Sessions were no longerin his position the Special Counsel would report directly to a nonrecused Attorney General.' McGahntold the President that things might not change much under a new Attorney General."48 McGahn also recalled that in or around July 2017, the President frequently brought up his displeasure with Sessions." Hicks recalled that the President viewed
Sessions's recusal from the Russia investigation as an act of disloyalty.'°° In additiontocriticizing
Sessions's recusal, the President raised other concerns about Sessions and his job performance
with McGahnand Hicks.'*!

Because of Sessions's recusal, if Rosenstein were no longerin his position, Brand would, by default, become the DOJofficial in charge of supervising the Special Counsel's investigation, and if both Sessions and Rosenstein were removed, Brand would be next in line to become Acting Attorney General for all DOJ matters.

2. Additional Efforts to Have Sessions Unrecuse or Direct Investigations Covered by his Recusal
Later in 2017, the President continued to urge Sessions to reverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an Attorney General who would notbe recused.
On October 16, 2017, the President met privately with Sessions and said that the Departmentof Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the
Departmentshould be investigating.""? According to contemporaneousnotes taken by Porter, who
wasat the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton's emails and said, "Don't havetotell us, just
take [a] look.""°? Sessions did not offer any assurances or promises to the President that the
Department of Justice would comply with that request.'** Two days later, on October 18, 2017, the President tweeted, "Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?""*° On October 29, 2017, the President tweeted that there was "ANGER & UNITY" over a "lack of investigation" of Clinton and "the Comey fix," and concluded: "DO
SOMETHING!"
On December6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with the Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end
of a cabinet meeting.""' During that Oval Office meeting, which Porter attended, the President
again suggested that Sessions could "unrecuse," which Porterlinked to taking back supervision of
the Russia investigation and directing an investigation of Hillary Clinton."* According to
contemporaneous notestaken by Porter, the President said, "I don't know if you could un-recuse yourself. You'd be a hero. Nottelling you to do anything. Dershowitz says POTUS can get involved. Can order AG to investigate. I don't wantto get involved. I'm notgoing to get involved.
I'm not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.""* According to Porter's notes, Sessions responded, "We are taking steps; whole new leadership

Analysis

In analyzing the President's efforts to have Sessions unrecuse himself and regain control
of the Russia investigation, the following considerations and evidenceare relevant to the elements of obstruction ofjustice:

a. Obstructive act. To determine if the President's efforts to have the Attorney General unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether
those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would take into accountthe supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play in the Russia
investigation. It also would have to take into account that the Attorney General's recusal covered

other campaign-related matters. The inquiry would not turn on what Attorney General Sessions would actually do if unrecused, but on whether the efforts to reverse his recusal would naturally havehadthe effect of impeding the Russia investigation.

On multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his recusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation and prosecution of Hillary Clinton. For example, in early summer 2017, Sessionsrecalled the President asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did nottake it as a directive. When the President
raised the issue again in December 2017, the President said, as recorded by Porter, "Nottelling
you to do anything. ... I'm not going to get involved. I'm not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just wantto be treated fairly." The duration of the President's efforts--which spanned from March 2017 to August 2018--and thefact that the President repeatedly criticized
Sessions in public and in private for failing to tell the President that he would haveto recuse is
relevant to assessing whetherthe President's efforts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as
obstructive acts.

b. Nexusto an official proceeding. As described above, by mid-June 2017, the existence

of a grandjury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. In addition,

in July 2017, a different grand jury supervised by the Special Counsel was empaneled in the

District of Columbia,

existence of this grand jury in early August
General would have a foreseeable impact on

those proceedings turns on much of the same evidence discussed above with respect to the

obstructive-act element.

c. Intent. There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President's conduct toward Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a way that wouldrestrictits scope. By the summer of 2017, the President was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating him personally for obstruction of justice. And in the wake ofthe disclosures of emails about the June 9 meeting between Russians and senior members of the campaign, see Volume II, Section II.G, supra, it was evident that the investigation into the campaign now included the President's son, son-in-law, and former campaign manager. The President had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions publicly announcethat the
Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future election interference. Yet Sessions
remained recused. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to
Sessionsin the Oval Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if
he unrecused. Porter linked that request to the President's desire that Sessions take back supervision of the Russia investigation and direct an investigation of Hillary Clinton. The President said in that meeting that he "just want[ed] to be treated fairly," which could reflect his perception that it was unfairthat he was being investigated while Hillary Clinton was not. But a
principal effect of that act would be to restore supervision of the Russia investigation to the
Attorney General--aposition that the President frequently suggested should be occupied by
someonelike Eric Holder and Bobby Kennedy, who the President described as protecting their

presidents. A reasonable inference from those statements and the President's actions is that the President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation.

I.

The President Orders McGahn to Deny that the President Tried to Fire the

Special Counsel

Overview

In late January 2018, the media reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel fired based on purported conflicts of interest but McGahn had refused, saying he would quit instead. After the story broke, the President, through his personal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn denythat he had been directed to remove the Special Counsel. Each time he was approached, McGahnresponded that he would notrefute the press accounts because they were accurate in reporting on the President's effort to have the Special Counsel removed. The President later personally met with McGahnin the Oval Office with only the ChiefofStaff present and tried to get McGahnto say that the President never ordered him to fire the Special Counsel. McGahn refused and insisted his memory of the President's direction to remove the Special Counsel was accurate. In that same meeting, the President challenged McGahnfor taking notes of his discussions with the President and asked why he had told Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel removed.

McGahn.*"?
Analysis

In analyzing the President's efforts to have McGahndeny that he had been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed, the following evidenceis relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

a.

Obstructive act. The President's repeated efforts to get McGahn tocreate a record

denying that the President had directed him to remove the Special Counsel would qualify as an

obstructive act if it had the natural tendency to constrain McGahnfrom testifying truthfully or to

undermine his credibility as a potential witnessif he testified consistently with his memory, rather

than with what the record said.

There is some evidencethat at the time the New York Times and Washington Post stories werepublishedin late January 2018, the Presidentbelieved the stories were wrong andthat he had never told McGahn to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. The President correctly understood that McGahnhadnottold the President directly that he planned to resign. In addition, the President told Priebus and Porter that he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and in the Oval Office meeting with McGahn, the Presidentsaid, "I never said to fire Mueller. I never said `fire."" That evidence could indicate that the President was not attempting to persuade McGahnto changehis story but wasinstead offering his own--but different--recollection of the substance of his June 2017 conversations with McGahn and McGahn's reaction to them.

Other evidence cuts against that understanding of the President's conduct. As previously described, see VolumeII, Section ILE, supra, substantial evidence supports McGahn's account that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed,including the timing and context of the President's directive; the manner in which McGahnreacted; and the fact that the President had been told the conflicts were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department of Justice, and should be raised with the President's personal counsel rather than broughtto McGahn. In addition, the President's subsequent denials that he had told McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed were carefully worded. Whenfirst asked about the New York Times story, the President said, "Fake news, folks. Fake news. A typical New York Timesfakestory." And when the President spoke with McGahn in the Oval Office, he focused on whether he had used the word"fire," saying, "I never said to fire Mueller. I never said `fire'" and "Did I say the word `fire'?" The President's assertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed McGahn to havethe Special Counsel removed thus runs counterto the evidence.

In addition, even if the President sincerely disagreed with McGahn's memory of the June 17, 2017 events, the evidence indicates that the President knew by the time of the Oval Office

828 McGahn 3/8/18 302, at 5. Kelly did not recall discussing the Oval Office meeting with the
Presidentafter the fact. Kelly 8/2/18 302, at 2. Handwritten notes taken by Kelly state, "Don[:] Mueller discussion in June. - Bannon Priebus - came out okay." WH000017685 (Kelly 2/6/18 Notes).

meeting that McGahn's accountdiffered and that McGahn wasfirm in his views. Shortly after the story broke, the President's counsel told McGahn's counselthat the President wanted McGahnto
make a statement denying he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel, but McGahn responded
through his counsel that that aspect of the story was accurate and he therefore could not comply with the President's request. .The President then directed Sandersto tell McGahnto correct the story, but McGahn told her he would not do so becausethe story was accurate in reporting on the President's order. Consistent with that position, McGahnneverissued a correction. More than a week later, the President brought up the issue again with Porter, made commentsindicating the President thought McGahn had leaked the story, and directed Porter to have McGahncreate a record denying that the President hadtriedto fire the Special Counsel. At that point, the President said he might "haveto get rid of' McGahn if McGahn did not comply. McGahn again refused and told Porter, as he had told Sanders andas his counsel hadtold the President's counsel, that the President had in fact ordered him to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. That evidence
indicates that by the time of the Oval Office meeting the President was aware that McGahndid not
think the story was false and did not want to issue a statement or create a written record denying
facts that McGahnbelieved to be true. The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahnto
repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate.

b. Nexus to an official proceeding. By January 2018, the Special Counsel's use of a

grand jury had been further confirmed by the return of several indictments. The President also

was aware that the Special Counsel wasinvestigating obstruction-related events because, among

other reasons, on January
detailed list of topics for

8, 2018,
a possible

the Special Counsel's Office provided his counsel with a
interview with the President.° The President knew that

McGahnhad personal knowledgeof manyofthe events the Special Counsel wasinvestigating and that McGahn hadalready beeninterviewed by Special Counsel investigators. And in the Oval

Office meeting, the President indicated he knew that McGahn had told the Special Counsel's

Office about the President's effort to remove the Special Counsel. The President challenged

McGahn for disclosing that information and for taking notes that he viewed as creating

unnecessary legal exposure. That evidence indicates the President's awareness that the June 17,

2017 events were relevantto the Special Counsel's investigation and any grand jury investigation

that might grow outofit.

Toestablish a nexus, it would be necessary to showthat the President's actions would have the natural tendencyto affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay, or prevent the communication ofinformation to investigators. Because McGahn had spoken to Special Counsel
investigators before January 2018, the President could not have been seekingto influencehis prior
statements in those interviews. But because McGahnhadrepeatedly spoken to investigators and
the obstruction inquiry was not complete, it was foreseeable that he would beinterviewed again
on obstruction-related topics. If the President were focused solely on a press strategy in seeking to have McGahn refute the New York Times article, a nexus to a proceeding or to further investigative interviews would not be shown. Butthe President's efforts to have McGahn write a letter "for our records" approximately ten daysafter the stories had come out--well pastthe typical

830 1/29/18 Letter, President's Personal Counsel to Special Counsel's Office, at 1-2 ("In our conversation of January 8, your office identified the following topics as areas you desired to address with the Presidentin order to complete yourinvestigation on the subjects ofalleged collusion and obstruction of justice"; listing 16 topics).

time to issue a correction for a news story--indicates the President was not focused solely on a press strategy, but instead likely contemplated the ongoing investigation and any proceedings arising from it.

©;

Intent. Substantial evidenceindicates that in repeatedly urging McGahnto dispute

that he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of

influencing McGahn's accountin order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President's

conduct towards the investigation.

Several facts support that conclusion. The President made repeated attempts to get McGahn to changehis story. As described above, by the time of the last attempt, the evidence suggests that the President had been told on multiple occasions that McGahnbelieved the President had ordered him to have the Special Counsel terminated. McGahninterpreted his encounter with the Presidentin the Oval Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he wasto his memory of what had occurred. The President had already laid the groundwork for pressing McGahn to alter his accountbytelling Porter that it might be necessary to fire McGahn if he did
not deny the story, and Porter relayed that statement to McGahn. Additional evidence of the President's intent may be gleaned from the fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed by the prospect of the President's meeting with McGahnthat he called McGahn's counseland said that McGahncould notresign no matter what happened in the Oval Office that day. The President's
counsel was well aware of McGahn's resolve not to issue what he believed to be a false account of events despite the President's request. Finally, as noted above, the President broughtup the Special Counsel investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGahnand criticized him for telling this Office about the June 17, 2017 events. The President's statements reflect his understanding--andhis displeasure--that those events would be part of an obstruction-of-justice inquiry.

The President's Conduct Towards Flynn, Manafort, SO

Overview

In addition to the interactions with McGahn described above, the President has taken other
actions directed at possible witnesses in the Special Counsel's investigation, including Flynn, Manafort, Gea and as describedin the next section, Cohen. When Flynn withdrew from a joint
defense agreementwith the President, the President's personal counsel stated that Flynn's actions
would be viewed asreflecting "hostility" towards the President. During Manafort's prosecution and while the jury was deliberating, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort wasbeing treated unfairly and madeit known that Manafort could receive a pardon. BETUMCMOn YT STy ETC

Evidence 1. Conduct Directed at Michael Flynn Aspreviously noted, see VolumeII, Section II.B, supra, the President asked for Flynn's resignation on February 13, 2017.

the President's personal counsel and counsel for the White Housethat Flynn could no longer have
confidential communications with the White House or the President.83* Later that night, the President's personal counselleft a voicemail for Flynn's counsel that said:
I understand your situation, but let me see if I can't state it in starker terms. ... [I]t wouldn't surprise me if you've gone on to make a deal with... the government....

Analysis

In analyzing the President's conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, Roa. the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

a.

Obstructive act. The President's actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel's

investigation would qualify as obstructive if they had the natural tendency to preventparticular

witnesses from testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have the probable effect of influencing,

delaying, or preventing their testimony to law enforcement.

With regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn encouraging him to stay strong and conveying that the President still cared about him before he began to cooperate with the government. When Flynn's attorneys withdrew him from a joint defense agreement with the President, signaling that Flynn was potentially cooperating with the government, the President's personal counsel initially reminded Flynn's counsel ofthe President's warm feelings towards Flynn andsaid "thatstill remains." But when Flynn's counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer share information under a joint defense agreement, the President's personal counsel stated that the decision would be interpreted as reflecting Flynn's hostility towards the President. That sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn's decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege issues, however, we could not determine whether the President waspersonally involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn's counsel.

With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President's actions had the potential to influence Manafort's decision whether to cooperate with the government. The President andhis personalcounsel made repeatedstatements suggesting that a pardon wasa possibility for Manafort, while also makingit clear that the President did not want Manafort to "flip" and cooperate with the government. On June 15, 2018, the day the judge presiding over Manafort's D.C. case was considering whether to revokehis bail, the President said that he "felt badly" for Manafort and stated, "I think a lot ofit is very unfair." And when asked about a pardon for Manafort, the President said, "I do want to see people treated fairly. That's whatit's all about." Later that day, after Manafort's bail was revoked, the President called it a "tough sentence" that was "Very unfair!" Two dayslater, the President's personal counsel stated that individuals involved in the Special Counsel's investigation could receive a pardon"if in fact the [P]resident and his advisors ... come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly"'--using language that paralleled how the President had already described the treatment of Manafort. Those statements, combined with the President's commendation ofManafort for being a "brave man" who"refusedto "break'," suggested that a pardon was a morelikely possibility if Manafort continued not to cooperate with the government. And while Manafort eventually pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, he was foundto have violated the agreementbylying to investigators.

The President's public statements during the Manafort trial, including during jury deliberations, also had the potential to influence the trial jury. On the second dayoftrial, for example,the President called the prosecution a "terrible situation" and a "hoax"that "continues to stain our country" and referred to Manafort as a "Reagan/Doledarling" who was"servingsolitary confinement" even though he was "convicted of nothing." Those statements were widely picked up by the press. While jurors were instructed not to watch or read newsstories about the case and

131

Work // P U.Sr . Deparo tmentot fJuste ice eted
are presumed to follow those instructions, the President's statements during the trial generated substantial media coverage that could have reached jurors if they happenedto see the statements or learned about them from others. And the President's statements during jury deliberations that Manafort "happens to be a very good person" and that"it's very sad what they've done to Paul Manafort" had thepotentialto influence jurors who learnedofthe statements, which the President madejust as jurors were considering whether to convict or acquit Manafort.
Harm to Ongoing Matter

b.

Nexus to an official proceeding. The President's actions towards Flynn, Manafort,

appearto have been connected to pendingor anticipated official proceedings involving

each individual. The President's conduct towards Fyn LOL principally occurred when both

were undercriminal investigation by the Special Counsel's Office and press reports speculated

about whether they would cooperate with the Special Counsel's investigation. And the President's

conduct towards Manafort wasdirectly connectedto the official proceedings involving him. The

President made statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort's criminal

trial. And the President's comments about the prospect of Manafort "flipping" occurred whenit

wasclear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury proceedings.

c.

Intent. Evidence concerning the President's intent related to Flynn as a potential

witnessis inconclusive. As previously noted, becauseof privilege issues we do not have evidence

establishing whether the President knew aboutor wasinvolvedin his counsel's communications

with Flynn's counsel stating that Flynn's decision to withdraw from the joint defense agreement

and cooperate President. And

with the government regardless of whatthe

towards the the President

continued to express sympathy for Flynn after he pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation

agreement, stating that Flynn had "led a very strong life" and the President "fe[It] very badly"

about what had happenedto him.

Evidence concerning the President's conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government. Before Manafort was
convicted, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort had been treated unfairly. One dayafter
Manafort was convicted on eight felony charges andpotentially faced a lengthy prison term, the President said that Manafort was"a brave man"forrefusing to "break" and that"flipping" "almost
oughtto be outlawed." At the sametime, although the President had privately told aides he did
not like Manafort, he publicly called Manafort "a good man" and said he had a "wonderfulfamily." And when the President was asked whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort, the President did not respond directly and instead said he had "great respect for what [Manafort]'s
done, in terms of what he's gone through." The President addedthat "someof the charges they
threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does." In light of the President's counsel's previous statements that the investigations "might get cleaned up with some
presidential pardons" and that a pardon would be possible if the President "come[s] to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly," the evidence supports the inference that the

132

U.S. Department of Justice Work // ProteetedUnderFed President intended Manafort to believe that he could receive a pardon, which would make cooperation with the government as a means of obtaining a lesser sentence unnecessary.
Wealso examined the evidenceofthe President's intent in making public statements about Manafort at the beginning of his trial and when the jury was deliberating. Some evidence supports
a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence the jury. The trial generated widespread publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate, commentators suggested that an acquittal would add to pressure to end the Special Counsel's investigation. By publicly stating on the second day of deliberations that Manafort "happens to be a very good person"andthat"it's very sad what
they've done to Paul Manafort" right after calling the Special Counsel's investigation a "rigged witch hunt," the President's statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural tendency to engender sympathy for Manafort among jurors, and a factfinder could infer that the President intendedthat result. But there are alternative explanations for the President's comments, including that he genuinely felt sorry for Manafort or that his goal was not to influence the jury but to influence public opinion. The President's comments also could have been intended to continue sending a message to Manafort that a pardon was possible. As described above, the President made his comments about Manafort being "a very good person" immediately after declining to answera question about whether he would pardon Manafort.

K. The President's Conduct Involving Michael Cohen Overview
The President's conduct involving Michael Cohen spans the full period of our investigation. During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscowproject on behalf of the Trump Organization. Cohen briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trumpshould travel to Russia to advance the deal. After the media began questioning Trump's connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a "party line" that publicly distanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there. Cohen continued to adhere to that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide documents and testimony in its Russia investigation. In an attempt to minimize the President's connections to Russia, Cohen submitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower Moscowprojectthree times, that he did not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen had notreceived a responseto an outreach he madeto the Russian government,and that the project ended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary. While working on the
congressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President's personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should not contradict the President and should keep the statement short and "tight." After the FBI searched Cohen's home and office in April 2018, the
President publicly asserted that Cohen would not "flip" and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do "something else" to make the investigation end. But after Cohen began cooperating with the governmentin July 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a "rat," and suggested his family members had committed crimes.
Evidence 1. Candidate Trump's Awareness of and Involvement in the Trump Tower
Moscow Project The President's interactions with Cohen as a witness took place against the background of the President's involvementin the Trump Tower Moscow project. As described in detail in VolumeI, Section IV.A.1, supra, from September 2015 until at least June 2016, the Trump Organization pursued a Trump Tower Moscowproject in Russia, with negotiations conducted by Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump Organization and
special counsel to Donald J. Trump.%? The Trump Organization had previously and
°° In August 2018 and November 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple crimes of deception,
including making false statements to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscowproject, as described later in this section. When Cohenfirst met with investigators from this Office, he repeated the same lies he told Congress about the Trump Tower Moscowproject. Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 12-17. But after Cohen pleaded guilty to offenses in the Southern District ofNew York on August 21, 2018, he met with investigators again and corrected the record. The Office found Cohen's testimony in these subsequent proffer sessions to be consistent with and corroborated by other information obtained in the course of the Office's investigation. The Office's sentencing submission in Cohen's criminal case stated: "Starting with his second meeting with the [Special Counsel's Office] in September 2018, the defendant has accepted responsibility not only for

2. Cohen Determines to Adhere to a "Party Line" Distancing Candidate Trump From Russia

Aspreviously discussed, see VolumeII, Section II.A, supra, when questions aboutpossible Russian support for candidate Trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump denied having any personal, financial, or business connection to Russia, which Cohen described
as the "party line"or "message"to follow for Trump andhis senior advisors.*"

After the election, the Trump Organization sought to formally close out certain deals in

advanceofthe inauguration."4° Cohen to be closed out." In approximately

recalled that Trump Tower Moscow wasonthelist of deals January 2017, Cohen began receiving inquiries from the

media about Trump Tower Moscow,and herecalled speaking to the President-Elect when those

inquiries came in.*" Cohen was concernedthattruthful answers about the Trump Tower Moscow

project might not be consistent with the "message" that the President-Elect had no relationship

with Russia."*

In an effort to "stay on message," Cohen told a New York Times reporter that the Trump
Tower Moscowdeal wasnotfeasible and had ended in January 2016.Cohenrecalled that this waspart of a "script" or talking points he had developed with President-Elect Trumpandothers to

Consistent with Cohen's intendedparty line message,thearticle stated, "Cohen said the Trump Organization hadreceiveda letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible."

dismiss the idea of a substantial connection between Trump and Russia." Cohen said that he discussed the talking points with Trump butthat he did not explicitly tell Trump he thought they
were untrue because Trumpalready knew they were untrue."°! Cohen thoughtit was importantto
say the deal was donein January 2016, rather than acknowledgethat talks continued in May and June 2016, because it limited the period when candidate Trump could be alleged to have a relationship with Russia to an early point in the campaign, before Trump had become the party's
presumptive nominee.'
3. Cohen Submits False Statements to Congress Minimizing the Trump Tower MoscowProject in Accordance with the Party Line
In early May 2017, Cohen received requests from Congress to provide testimony and documents in connection with congressional investigations of Russian interference in the 2016
election? At that time, Cohen understood Congress's interest in him to be focused on the
allegations in the Steele reporting concerning a meeting Cohen allegedly had with Russianofficials in Prague during the campaign.?* Cohen had nevertraveled to Prague and was not concerned about those allegations, which he believed were provably false.9°° On May 18, 2017, Cohen met with the President to discuss the request from Congress, and the President instructed Cohen that
he should cooperate because there was nothing there.?>°
Cohen eventually entered into a joint defense agreement (JDA)with the President and other
individuals who were part of the Russia investigation." In the months leading up to his
congressional testimony, Cohen frequently spoke with the President's personal counsel.** Cohen

Cohen told investigators about his conversations with the President's personal counsel after waiving any privilege of his own and after this Office advised his counsel not to provide any communications that would be covered by any otherprivilege, including communications protected by a joint defense or commoninterest privilege. As a result, most of what Cohentold us about his conversations with the President's personal counsel concerned what Cohen had communicated to the President's personal counsel, and not what wassaid in response. Cohen described certain statements made by the President's personal counsel, however, that are set forth in this section. Cohen and his counsel were better positioned than this Office to evaluate whether any privilege protected those statements because they had knowledge of the scope oftheir joint defense agreement and access to privileged communications that may have provided contextfor evaluating the statements they shared. After interviewing Cohen about these matters, we asked the President's personal counsel if he wished to provide information to us about his conversations with Cohenrelated to Cohen's congressional testimony about

said that in those conversations the President's personal counsel would sometimes say that he had
just been with the President.Cohen recalled that the President's personal counseltold him the
JDA was working well together and assured him that there was nothing there and if they stayed on message the investigations would come to an end soon.At that time, Cohen's legal bills were being paid by the Trump Organization,*®! and Cohen was told not to worry because the
investigations would be over by summeror fall of 2017.Cohen said that the President's personal counselalso conveyed that, as part ofthe JDA, Cohen wasprotected, which he would not
be if he "went rogue."* Cohenrecalled that the President's personal counsel reminded him that "the President loves you"and told him that if he stayed on message, the President had his back.°TM
In August 2017, Cohen began drafting a statement about Trump Tower Moscowto submit to Congress along with his document production." The final version of the statementcontained several false statements aboutthe project.°First, although the Trump Organization continuedto pursue the project until at least June 2016, the statement said, "The proposal was under consideration at the Trump Organization from September 2015 until the end of January 2016. By the end of January 2016, I determined that the proposal was not feasible for a variety of business reasons and should not be pursued further. Based on my business determinations, the Trump
Organization abandoned the proposal."°6" Second, although Cohen and candidate Trump had
discussed possible travel to Russia by Trumpto pursue the venture, the statementsaid, "Despite overtures by Mr. Sater, I never considered asking Mr. Trumpto travel to Russia in connection with this proposal. I told Mr. Sater that Mr. Trump would not travel to Russia unless there was a definitive agreementin place."* Third, although Cohen had regularly briefed Trump onthestatus
Trump Tower Moscow. The President's personal counsel declined and, through his own counsel, indicated that he could not disaggregate information he had obtained from Cohen from information he had obtained from other parties in the JDA. In view of the admonition this Office gave to Cohen's counsel to withhold communications that could be covered by privilege, the President's personal counsel's uncertainty about the provenanceofhis own knowledge, the burden on a privilege holder to establish the elements to support a claim ofprivilege, and the substance of the statements themselves, we have included relevant statements Cohen provided in this report. If the statements were to be used in a context beyondthis report, further analysis could be warranted.

[{]n order to get his sentence reduced, [Cohen] says "I have anidea,I'll ah, tell--I'Il give you some information onthe president." Well, there is no information.

Analysis

In analyzing the President's conduct related to Cohen, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice.

a.

Obstructive act. We gathered evidence of the President's conduct related to Cohen

on two issues: (i) whether the Presidentor others aided or participated in Cohen's false statements

to Congress, and (ii) whether the President took actions that would have the natural tendency to

prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to the government.

i.

First, with regard to Cohen's false statements to Congress, while there is

evidence, described below, that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress

about the Trump Tower Moscowproject, the evidence available to us does not establish that the

President directed or aided Cohen's false testimony.

Cohensaid that his statements to Congress followed a "party line" that developed within the campaignto align with the President's public statements distancing the President from Russia. Cohenalsorecalled that, in speaking with the President in advanceoftestifying, he madeit clear that he would stay on message--which Cohen believed they both understood would require false
testimony. But Cohen said that he and the Presidentdid not explicitly discuss whether Cohen's testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or wasfalse, and the President did
not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohenalso said he did nottell the President about the
specifics of his planned testimony. During the time whenhis statement to Congress was being drafted and circulated to members of the JDA, Cohen did not speak directly to the President about
the statement, but rather communicated with the President's personal counsel--as corroborated by
phone records showing extensive communications between Cohen and the President's personal counsel before Cohen submitted his statement and whenhetestified before Congress.

Cohenrecalled that in his discussions with the President's personal counsel on August 27,
2017--the day before Cohen's statement was submitted to Congress--Cohensaid that there were more communications with Russia and more communications with candidate Trump than the
statement reflected. Cohen recalled expressing some concernatthat time. According to Cohen,
the President's personal counsel--who did not have first-hand knowledge of the project-- responded by sayingthat there was no need to muddy the water, that it was unnecessary to include those details because the project did not take place, and that Cohen should keep his statement short andtight, not elaborate, stay on message, and not contradict the President. Cohen's recollection of the content of those conversations is consistent with direction about the substance of Cohen's draft statement that appeared to come from members of the JDA. For example, Cohen omitted any reference to his outreach to Russian governmentofficials to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the United Nations General Assembly, and Cohenbelieved it was a decision of

of conversations beyond that contained in the President's [written responses to the Special Counsel's Office]." 2/6/19 Letter, President's Personal Counsel to Special Counsel's Office.

the JDAto delete the sentence, "The building project led me to make limited contacts with Russian government officials."

The President's personal counsel declined to provide us with his account of his conversations with Cohen, and there is no evidence available to us that indicates that the President was awareofthe information Cohen provided to the President's personal counsel. The President's conversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by attorney-clientprivilege, and we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such communications. The absence of evidence about the President and his counsel's conversations about the drafting of Cohen's statement precludes us from assessing what, if any, role the President played.

ii.

Second, we considered whether the President tookactions that would have

the natural tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to criminal

investigators or to Congress.

Before Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly and privately urged Cohento stay on message and not "flip." Cohen recalled the President's personal counsel telling him that he would be protected so long as he did not go "rogue." In the days and weeks that followed the April 2018 searches of Cohen's homeandoffice, the Presidenttold reporters that Cohenwasa "good man"and said he was"a fine person with a wonderful family ... who I have always liked & respected." Privately, the President told Cohen to "hang in there" and "stay strong." People who wereclose to both Cohen and the President passed messages to Cohen that "the President loves you,""the boss loves you," and "everyone knowsthe boss has your back." Throughthe President's personal counsel, the President also had previously told Cohen "thanks for what you do" after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to womenthat, according to Cohen, both Cohen and the President knew wasfalse. At that time, the Trump Organization continued to pay Cohen's legal fees, which was important to Cohen. Cohenalso recalled discussing the possibility of a pardon with the President's personal counsel, who told him to stay on message and everything wouldbe fine. The Presidentindicated in his public statements that a pardon had not been ruled out, and also stated publicly that "[m]Jost people will flip if the Governmentlets them out of trouble" but that he "d[idn't] see Michael doing that."

After it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government, however, the President accused Cohen of "mak[ing] up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?)," called Cohen a "rat," and on multiple occasions publicly suggested that Cohen's family members had committed crimes. The evidence concerning this sequence of events could support an inference that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks andintimidation to deter the provision of information or undermine Cohen's credibility once Cohen began cooperating.

b.

Nexus to an official proceeding. The President's relevant conduct towards Cohen

occurred whenthe President knew the Special Counsel's Office, Congress, and the U.S. Attorney's

Office for the Southern District of New York were investigating Cohen's conduct. The President

acknowledged through his public statements and tweets that Cohen potentially could cooperate

with the governmentinvestigations.

154

c.

Intent. In analyzing the President's intent in his actions towards Cohen as a

potential witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to

discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen's information would shed

adverse light on the President's campaign-period conduct and statements.

i.

Cohen's false congressional testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow

project was designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit

the congressional and DOJ Russia investigations--a goal that wasin the President's interest, as reflected by the President's own statements. During and after the campaign, the President made repeated statements that he had "no business" in Russia and said that there were "no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away." As Cohen knew, and asherecalled communicating to the President during the campaign, Cohen's pursuit of the Trump Tower

Moscowproject cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness of these statements.

In connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations with candidate Trump to give him status updates about the Trump Tower Moscowproject, that the conversations continued through at least June 2016, and that he discussed with Trumppossible travel to Russia to pursue the project. The conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen, because the project had the potential to be so lucrative. In addition, text messages to and from Cohen and other records further establish that Cohen's efforts to advance the project did not end in January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen wasconsidering the timing for possible trips to Russia by him and Trumpin connection with the project.

The evidence could support an inference that the President was aware of these facts at the time of Cohen's false statements to Congress. Cohen discussed the project with the Presidentin early 2017 following media inquiries. Cohen recalled that on September 20, 2017, the day after he released to the public his opening remarks to Congress--whichsaid the project "was terminated in January of 2016"--the President's personal counsel told him the President was pleased with what Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow. Andafter Cohen's guilty plea, the President told reporters that he had ultimately decided not to do the project, which supports the inference that he remained aware ofhis own involvementin the project and the period during the Campaign in which the project was' being pursued.

ii. The President's public remarks following Cohen's guilty plea also suggest that the President may have been concerned about what Cohentold investigators about the Trump Tower Moscowproject. At the time the President submitted written answers to questions from this Office about the project and other subjects, the media had reported that Cohen was cooperating with the government but Cohenhadnot yet pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress. Accordingly, it was not publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided to the government. In his written answers, the President did not provide details about the timing and substanceof his discussions with Cohen about the project and gave no indication that he had decided to no longer pursue the project. Yet after Cohen pleaded guilty, the President publicly stated that he had personally madethe decision to abandonthe project. The Presidentthen declined to clarify the seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions. The content and timing of the President's provision of information about his knowledge and actions regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President may have been concernedaboutthe information that Cohen could provide as a witness.

155

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney_Werk // Protected

iii. The President's concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed at the Southern District of New Yorkinvestigation into other aspects of the President's dealings with Cohenrather than an investigation of Trump Tower Moscow. There also is some evidence that the President's concern about Cohen cooperating was based onthe President's stated belief that Cohen would provide false testimony against the President in an attempt to obtain a lesser sentencefor his unrelated criminal conduct. The President tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen, refused to "break" and "makeupstories in order to get a `deal.'" And after Cohenpleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress, the President said, "what [Cohen]'s trying to do is get a reduced sentence. So he's lying about a project that everybody knew about." But the President also appeared to defend the underlying conduct, saying, "Even if [Cohen] wasright, it doesn't matter because I was allowed to do whateverI wanted during the campaign." As described above, there is evidencethat the President knew that Cohen had made false statements about the Trump Tower Moscowproject and that Cohendid so to protect the President and minimizethe President's connections to Russia during the campaign.

iv. Finally, the President's statements insinuating that members of Cohen's family committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the governmentcould be viewed as an effort to retaliate against Cohen andchill further testimony adverse to the President by Cohen or others. It is possible that the President believes, as reflected in his tweets, that Cohen "ma[d]e[] up stories" in order to get a deal for himself and "get his wife and father-in-law .. . off Scott Free." It also is possible that the President's mention of Cohen's wife and father-in-law were notintended to affect Cohen as a witness but rather were part of a public-relations strategy aimed at discrediting Cohen and deflecting attention away from the President on Cohen-related matters. But the President's suggestion that Cohen's family members committed crimes happened morethan once, including just before Cohen wassentenced(at the same timeas the President stated that Cohen "should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence") and again just before Cohen was scheduledto testify before Congress. The timing of the statements supports an inferencethat they wereintendedatleast in part to discourage Cohen from further cooperation.

L.

Overarching Factual Issues

Although this report does not contain a traditional prosecution decision or declination decision, the evidence supports several general conclusions relevant to analysis of the facts concerning the President's course of conduct.

1. Three features of this case renderit atypical compared to the heartland obstruction-ofjustice prosecutions brought by the Departmentof Justice.

First, the conduct involved actionsby the President. Some of the conduct did not implicate the President's constitutional authority and raises garden-variety obstruction-of-justice issues. Other events we investigated, however, drew upon the President's Article II authority, which raised constitutional issues that we address in VolumeII, Section III-B, infra. A factual analysis of that conduct would have to take into accountboth that the President's acts were facially lawful and that his position as head of the Executive Branch provides him with unique and powerful means of influencingofficial proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses.

156

U.S. Departmentof Justice Acttorey-Work // Protected
Second, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up of an underlying crime. Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence that the individual had an improper obstructive purpose, see, e.g., United States v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 24 (2d Cir. 1988), or that he contemplated an effect on an official proceeding, see, e.g., United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 591 (2d Cir. 2015). But proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction offense. See United States v. Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir. 2017)(stating, in applying the obstruction sentencing guideline, that "obstruction of a criminal investigation is punishable even if the prosecutionis ultimately unsuccessfulor even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying crime"). Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.
In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the President's conduct. These include concernsthat continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events--such as advance notice of WikiLeaks's release of hacked informationorthe June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaignofficials and Russians-- could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.
Third, many of the President's acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in public view. While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were motivated by a corrupt intent, the President's powerto influence actions, persons, and events is enhanced by his uniqueability to attract attention through use of mass communications. And no principle of law excludes public acts from the scope of obstruction statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to intimidate witnessesoralter their testimony,the justice system's integrity is equally threatened.
2. Although the events we investigated involved discrete acts--e.g., the President's statement to Comey about the Flynn investigation, his termination of Comey, and his efforts to removethe Special Counsel--itis important to view the President's pattern of conduct as a whole. That pattern shedslight on the nature of the President's acts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent.
a. Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General's recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influencetheir testimony. Viewing the acts collectively can help to illuminate their significance. For example, the President's direction to McGahnto have the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediately by his direction to Lewandowski to tell the Attorney General to limit the scope of the Russia investigation to prospective election-interference only--a temporal connection that suggests that both acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the investigation.
157

U.S. Departmentof Justice Work // Proteeted
The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comeydid not endthe investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn's prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahndid nottell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President's order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President's message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahnrefused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President's direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President's multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President's aides and associates beyond thosealreadyfiled.
b. In considering the full scope of the conduct weinvestigated, the President's actions can be divided into two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President's motives. In the first phase, before the President fired Comey, the President had been assured that the FBI had not opened an investigation of him personally. The President deemed it critically important to make public that he was not under investigation, and he included that information in his termination letter to Comeyafter other efforts to have that information disclosed were unsuccessful.
Soon after he fired Comey, however, the President became aware that investigators were conducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into his own conduct. That awareness marked a significant change in the President's conduct and the start of a second phase of action. The President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation. For instance, the President attempted to remove the Special Counsel; he sought to have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the investigation; he sought to prevent public disclosure of information aboutthe June 9, 2016 meeting between Russians and campaignofficials; and he used public forumsto attack potential witnesses who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the government. Judgments about the nature of the President's motives during each phase would be informed by thetotality of the evidence.

Ill. LEGAL DEFENSES TO THE APPLICATION OF OBSTRUCTION-OF-JUSTICE STATUTES TO THE PRESIDENT
The President's personal counsel has written to this Office to advance statutory and constitutional defenses to the potential application of the obstruction-of-justice statutes to the
President's conduct.!° As a statutory matter, the President's counsel has argued that a core obstruction-of-justice statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2), does not cover the President's actions.'°"
As a constitutional matter, the President's counsel argued that the President cannot obstruct justice by exercising his constitutional authority to close DepartmentofJustice investigations or terminate the FBI Director.'°* Under that view, any statute that restricts the President's exercise of those powers would impermissibly intrude on the President's constitutional role. The President's counsel has concededthat the President may be subject to criminal lawsthat do not directly involve exercises of his Article II authority, such as laws prohibiting bribing witnesses or suborning
perjury.'°> But counsel has made a categorical argument that "the President's exercise ofhis
constitutional authority here to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations cannot
constitutionally constitute obstruction ofjustice."!°"
In analyzing counsel's statutory arguments, we concluded that the President's proposed interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2) is contrary to the litigating position of the Department of Justice and is not supported by principles of statutory construction.
As for the constitutional arguments, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the courts have not definitively resolved these constitutional issues. We therefore analyzed the President's position through the framework of Supreme Court precedent addressing the separation of powers. Under that framework, we concluded, Article II of the Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize the President from potentialliability for the conduct that weinvestigated. Rather, our analysis led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can

validly prohibit a President's corrupt efforts to use his official powersto curtail, end, or interfere with an investigation.

A.

Statutory Defenses to the Application of Obstruction-Of-Justice Provisions to

the Conduct Under Investigation

Theobstruction-of-justice statute most readily applicable to our investigation is 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c) provides:

(c) Whoever corruptly--

(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding; or

(2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes anyofficial proceeding, or attempts to do so,

shall be fined under thistitle or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

The Department of Justice has taken the position that Section 1512(c)(2) states a broad,
independent, and unqualified prohibition on obstruction of justice.' While defendants have
argued that subsection (c)(2) should be read to'cover only acts that would impair the availability or integrity of evidence because that is subsection (c)(1)'s focus, strong arguments weigh against that proposedlimitation. The text of Section 1512(c)(2) confirms that its sweep is not tethered to Section 1512(c)(1); courts have so interpreted it; its history does not counsel otherwise; and no principle of statutory construction dictates a contrary view. On its face, therefore, Section 1512(c)(2) applies to all corrupt means of obstructing a proceeding, pending or contemplated-- including by improperexercises ofofficial power. In addition, other statutory provisions that are potentially applicable to certain conduct we investigated broadly prohibit obstruction of proceedings that are pending before courts, grand juries, and Congress. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505. Congress has also specifically prohibited witness tampering. See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b).

1. The Text of Section 1512(c)(2) Prohibits a Broad Range of Obstructive Acts

Several textual features of Section 1512(c)(2) support the conclusion that the provision broadly prohibits corrupt means of obstructing justice and is not limited by the more specific prohibitions in Section 1512(c)(1), which focus on evidence impairment.
First, the text of Section 1512(c)(2) is unqualified: it reaches acts that "obstruct[], influence[], or impede[] any official proceeding" when committed "corruptly." Nothing in Section 1512(c)(2)'s text limits the provision to acts that would impair the integrity or availability of evidence for use in an official proceeding. In contrast, Section 1512(c)(1) explicitly includes the requirement that the defendantact "with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability

1077 See U.S. Br., United States v. Kumar, Nos. 06-5482-cr(L), 06-5654--cr(CON)(2d Cir. filed Oct. 26, 2007), at pp. 15-28; United States v. Singleton, Nos. H-04-CR-514SS, H-06-cr-80 (S.D. Tex. filed June 5, 2006).

for use in an official proceeding," a requirement that Congressalso included in twoother sections of Section 1512. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512(a)(2)(B)(ii) (use of physical force with intent to cause a person to destroy an object "with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use in an official proceeding"); 1512(b)(2)(B) (use of intimidation, threats, corrupt persuasion, or misleading conduct with intent to cause a person to destroy an object "with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use in an official proceeding"). But no comparableintent or conduct element focused on evidence impairment appears in Section 1512(c)(2). The intent element in Section 1512(c)(2) comes from the word "corruptly." See, e.g., United States v. McKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th Cir. 2011) ("The intent element is important because the word `corruptly' is what serves to separate criminal and innocent acts of obstruction.") (internal quotation marks omitted). And the conduct element in Section 1512(c)(2) is "obstruct[ing], influenc[ing], or imped[ing]" a proceeding. Congress is presumed to have acted intentionally in the disparate inclusion and exclusion of evidence-impairment language. See Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.S. 351, 358 (2014) ("[W]hen `Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another'--let alone in the very next provision--this Court `presume[s]' that Congress intended a difference in meaning") (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)); accord Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers, 138 S. Ct. 767, 777 (2018).
Second, the structure of Section 1512 supports the conclusion that Section 1512(c)(2) defines an independentoffense. Section 1512(c)(2) delineates a complete crime with different elements from Section 1512(c)(1)--and each subsection of Section 1512(c) contains its own "attempt" prohibition, underscoring that they are independent prohibitions. The two subsections of Section 1512(c) are connected by the conjunction "or," indicating that each provides an alternative basis for criminalliability. See Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357 ("ordinary use [of `or'] is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given separate meanings") (internal quotation marks omitted). In Loughrin, for example, the Supreme Court relied on the use of the word "or" to hold that adjacent and overlapping subsections of the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1344, state distinct offenses and that subsection 1344(2) therefore should not be interpreted to contain an additional element specified only in subsection 1344(1). Jd; see also Shaw v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 462, 465-469 (2016) (recognizing that the subsections of the bank fraud statute "overlap substantially" but identifying distinct circumstances covered by
each).'°78 And here, as in Loughrin, Section 1512(c)'s "two clauses have separate numbers, line
breaks before, between, and after them, and equivalent indentation--thus placing the clauses visually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings." 573 U.S. at 359.
Third, the introductory word "otherwise" in Section 1512(c)(2) signals that the provision covers obstructive acts that are different from thoselisted in Section 1512(c)(1). See Black's Law Dictionary 1101 (6th ed. 1990) ("otherwise" means"in a different manner; in another way, or in other ways"); see also, e.g., American Heritage College Dictionary Online ("1. In another way;
1078 The Office of Legal Counsel recently relied on several of the same interpretive principles in concluding that language that appearedin the first clause of the Wire Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1084, restricting its prohibition against certain betting or wagering activities to "any sporting event or contest," did not apply to the second clause of the same statute, which reaches other betting or wagering activities. See Reconsidering Whether the Wire Act Applies to Non-Sports Gambling (Nov. 2, 2018), slip op. 7 (relying on plain language); id. at 11 (finding it not "tenable to read into the second clause the qualifier `on any sporting event or contest' that appearsin the first clause"); id. at 12 (relying on Digital Realty).

differently; 2. Under other circumstances"); see also Gooch v. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 128 (1936)(characterizing "otherwise" as a "broad term" and holding that a statutory prohibition on kidnapping "for ransom or reward or otherwise" is not limited by the words "ransom" and "reward" to kidnappings for pecuniary benefits); Collazos v. United States, 368 F.3d 190, 200 (2d Cir. 2004) (construing "otherwise" in 28 U.S.C. § 2466(1)(C) to reach beyond the "specific examples"listed in prior subsections, thereby covering the "myriad means that human ingenuity might devise to permit a person to avoid the jurisdiction of a court"); cf Begay v. United States, 553 US. 137, 144 (2006) (recognizing that "otherwise" is defined to mean "in a different way or manner," and holding that the word "otherwise" introducing the residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), can, but need not necessarily, "refer to a crime thatis similar to the listed examples in somerespects butdifferent in others").!°" The purpose of the word "otherwise" in Section 1512(c)(2) is therefore to clarify that the provision covers obstructive acts other than the destruction of physical evidence with the intent to impair its integrity or availability, which is the conduct addressed in Section 1512(c)(1). The word "otherwise" does not signal that Section 1512(c)(2) has less breadth in covering obstructive conduct than the language of the provision implies.
2. Judicial Decisions Support a Broad Reading of Section 1512(c)(2) Courts have not limited Section 1512(c)(2) to conduct that impairs evidence, but instead have readit to cover obstructive acts in any form. As one court explained, "[t]his expansive subsection operates as a catch-all to cover `otherwise' obstructive behavior that might not constitute a more specific offense like document destruction, whichis listed in (c)(1)." United States v. Volpendesto, 746 F.3d 273, 286 (7th Cir. 2014) (some quotation marks omitted). For example, in United States v. Ring, 628 F. Supp. 2d 195 (D.D.C. 2009), the court rejected the argumentthat "§ 1512(c)(2)'s reference to conduct that `otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes anyofficial proceeding' is limited to conductthatis similar to the type of conduct proscribed by subsection (c)(1)--namely, conduct that impairs the integrity or availability of `record[s], documents[s], or other object[s] for use in an official proceeding." Jd. at 224. The court explained that "the meaning of § 1512(c)(2) is plain onits face." Jd. (alternations in original), And courts have upheld convictions underSection 1512(c)(2) that did not involve evidence impairment, but instead resulted from conduct that more broadly thwarted arrests or investigations. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, 862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. 2017) (police officer tipped off suspects about issuance of arrest warrants before "outstanding warrants could be executed, thereby potentially interfering with an ongoing grand jury proceeding"); United States v. Ahrensfield, 698 F.3d 1310, 1324-1326 (10th Cir. 2012) (officer disclosed existence of an undercoverinvestigation to its target); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d 1261, 1265 (10th Cir. 2009) (defendantdisclosed identity of an undercoverofficer thus preventing him from making controlled purchases from methamphetamine dealers). Those cases illustrate that Section 1512(c)(2) applies to corrupt acts--including by public officials--that frustrate the
1979 Tn Sykes v. United States, 564 U.S. 1, 15 (2011), the Supreme Court substantially abandoned Begay's readingofthe residual clause, and in Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), the Court invalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. Begay's analysis of the word "otherwise" is thusoflimited value.

commencementor conduct of a proceeding, and notjust to acts that make evidence unavailable or impairits integrity.
Section 1512(c)(2)'s breadth is reinforced by the similarity of its language to the omnibus clause of 18 U.S.C. § 1503, which covers anyone who "corruptly . . . obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice." That clause of Section 1503 follows two morespecific clauses that protect jurors, judges, and court officers. The omnibusclause has nevertheless been construed to be "far more general in scope than the earlier clausesofthe statute." United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 599 (1995). "The omnibusclause is essentially a catch-all provision which generally prohibits conduct that interferes with the due administration ofjustice." United States v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir. 1997). Courts have accordingly givenit a "non-restrictive reading." United States v. Kumar, 617 F.3d 612, 620 (2d Cir. 2010); id, at 620 n.7 (collecting cases from the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits). As one court has explained, the omnibusclause "prohibits acts that are similarin result, rather than manner, to the conduct described in the first part of the statute." United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d 1331, 1333 (5th Cir. 1978). While the specific clauses "forbid certain means of obstructing justice . . . the omnibus clause aims at obstruction ofjusticeitself, regardless of the means usedto reach that result." Jd. (collecting cases). Giventhe similarity of Section 1512(c)(2) to Section 1503's omnibus clause, Congress would have expected Section 1512(c)(2) to cover acts that produced a similar result to the evidence-impairmentprovisions--i.e., the result of obstructing justice--rather than covering only acts that were similar in manner. Read this way, Section 1512(c)(2) serves a distinct function in the federal obstruction-of-justice statutes: it captures corrupt conduct, other than document destruction, that has the natural tendency to obstruct contemplated as well as pending proceedings.
Section 1512(c)(2) overlaps with other obstruction statutes, but it does not render them superfluous. Section 1503, for example, which covers pending grand jury and judicial proceedings, and Section 1505, which covers pending administrative and congressional proceedings, reach "endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede" the proceedings--a broadertest for inchoate violations than Section 1512(c)(2)'s "attempt" standard, which requires a substantial step towards a completed offense. See United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287, 302 (2d Cir. 2018) ("[E]fforts to witness tamper that rise to the level of an `endeavor' yet fall short of an `attempt' cannot be prosecuted under § 1512."); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th Cir. 1988) (collecting cases recognizing the difference between the "endeavor" and "attempt" standards). And 18 U.S.C. § 1519, which prohibits destruction of documents or recordsin contemplation of an investigation or proceeding, does not require the "nexus" showing under Aguilar, which Section 1512(c)(2) demands. See, e.g., United States v. Yielding, 657 F.3d 688, 712 (8th Cir. 2011) ("The requisite knowledgeandintent [under Section 1519] can be present even if the accused lacks knowledgethat heis likely to succeed in obstructing the matter."); United States v. Gray, 642 F.3d 371, 376-377 (2d Cir. 2011) ("[I]n enacting § 1519, Congress rejected any requirementthat the government prove a link between a defendant's conduct and an imminent or pendingofficial proceeding."). The existence of even "substantial" overlap is not "uncommon" in criminal statutes. Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 359 n.4; see Shaw, 137 S. Ct. at 458-469; Aguilar, 515 USS. at 616 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("The fact that there is now some overlap between § 1503 and § 1512 is no moreintolerable than the fact that there is some overlap between the omnibus clause of § 1503 and the other provisions of § 1503 itself."). But given that Sections 1503, 1505, and

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WorkProduet // PrMay-Conti oMateriltect Fed R-e Crint P-6d fe)}
1519 each reach conductthat Section 1512(c)(2) does not, the overlap provides no reasonto give
Section 1512(c)(2) an artificially limited construction. See Shaw, 137 S. Ct. at 469.1%
3. The Legislative History of Section 1512(c)(2) Does Not Justify Narrowing Its Text
"Given the straightforward statutory command"in Section 1512(c)(2), "there is no reason to resort to legislative history." United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 6 (1997). In any event, the legislative history of Section 1512(c)(2) is not a reason to impose extratextual limitations on its reach.
Congressenacted Section 1512(c)(2) as part the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204, Tit. XI, § 1102, 116 Stat. 807. The relevant section of the statute was entitled "Tampering with a Record or Otherwise Impeding an Official Proceeding." 116 Stat. 807 (emphasis added). Thattitle indicates that Congress intended the twoclauses to have independent effect. Section 1512(c) was added as a floor amendmentin the Senate and explained asclosing a certain "loophole" with respect to "document shredding." See 148 Cong. Rec. $6545 (July 10, 2002) (Sen. Lott); id. at S6549-S6550 (Sen: Hatch). But those explanations do notlimit the enacted text. See Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 488 U.S. 105, 115 (1988) ("[I]t is not the law that a statute can have no effects whichare not explicitly mentionedin its legislative history."); see also Encino Motorcars, LLC y. Navarro, 138 S. Ct. 1134, 1143 (2018) ("Even if Congress did not foresee all of the applications of the statute, that is no reason notto give the statutory text a fair reading."). The floor statements thus cannot detract from the meaning of the enacted text. See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 457 (2002) ("Floor statements from two Senators cannot amendthe clear and unambiguous language of a statute. We see no reasonto give greater weight to the views of two Senators than to the collective votes of both Houses, which are memorialized in the unambiguousstatutory text."). That principle has particular force where one of the proponents of the amendment to Section 1512 introduced his remarks as only "briefly elaborat[ing] on some of the specific provisions containedin this bill." 148 Cong. Rec. $6550 (Sen. Hatch).
Indeed, the language Congress used in Section 1512(c)(2)--prohibiting "corruptly . . . obstruct[ing], influenc[ing], or imped[ing] any official proceeding" or attempting to do so-- parallels a provision that Congress considered years earlier in a bill designed to strengthen protections against witness tampering and obstruction ofjustice. While the earlier provision is not a direct antecedent of Section 1512(c)(2), Congress's understanding of the broad scope of the
1089 The Supreme Court's decision in Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101 (2018), does not support imposing a non-textuallimitation on Section 1512(c)(2). Marinello interpreted the tax obstruction statute, 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a), to require "a `nexus' between the defendant's conduct and a particular administrative proceeding." Jd. at 1109. The Court adopted that construction in light of the similar interpretation given to "other obstruction provisions,"id. (citing Aguilar and Arthur Andersen), as well as considerationsof context, legislative history, structure of the criminal tax laws, fair warning, and lenity. Jd. at 1106-1108. The type of "nexus" element the Court adopted in Marinello already applies under Section 1512(c)(2), and the remaining considerations the Court cited do notjustify reading into Section 1512(c)(2)
languagethatis not there. See Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29 (1997)(the Court "ordinarily resist[s] reading wordsor elements into a statute that do not appearonits face.").

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WoerkPreduet // PrMay-Conti oMateriltect Fed R-e Crimt P-6d fe)
earlier provision is instructive. Recognizing that "the proper administration of justice may be impeded or thwarted" by a "variety of corrupt methods . . . limited only by the imagination of the criminally inclined," S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-18 (1982), Congress considered a bill that would have amended Section 1512 by making it a crime, inter alia, when a person "corruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes. . . [t]he enforcement and prosecution of federal
law," "administration of a law under which anofficial proceeding is being or may be conducted,"
or the "exercise of a Federal legislative power of inquiry." Jd. at 17-19 (quoting S. 2420). The Senate Committee explained that: [T]he purpose of preventing an obstruction of or miscarriage of justice cannot befully carried out by a simple enumeration of the commonly prosecuted obstruction offenses. There mustalso be protection against the rare type of conductthat is the product of the inventive criminal mind and which also thwarts justice.
Id. at 18. The report gave examples of conduct "actually prosecuted under the current residual clause [in 18 U.S.C. § 1503], which would probably notbe covered in this series [of provisions] without a residual clause." Jd. One prominent example was "[a] conspiracy to cover up the Watergate burglary andits aftermath by having the Central Intelligence Agency seek to interfere with an ongoing FBI investigation of the burglary." Id. (citing United States v. Haldeman, 559 F.2d 31 (D.C. Cir. 1976)). The report therefore indicates a congressional awareness notonly that residual-clause language resembling Section 1512(c)(2) broadly covers a wide variety of
obstructive conduct, but also that such language reaches the improper use of governmental
processes to obstruct justice--specifically, the Watergate cover-up orchestrated by White House
officials including the President himself. See Haldeman, 559 F.3d at 51, 86-87, 120-129, 162.'°8!
4. General Principles of Statutory Construction Do Not Suggest That Section 1512(c)(2) is Inapplicable to the Conduct in this Investigation
The requirement of fair warning in criminal law, the interest in avoiding due process concerns in potentially vague statutes, and the rule of lenity do notjustify narrowing the reach of
Section 1512(c)(2)'s text.'% a. As with other criminal laws, the Supreme Court has "exercised restraint" in interpreting
obstruction-of-justice provisions, both out of respect for Congress's role in defining crimes andin the interest of providing individuals with "fair warning" of what a criminal statute prohibits. Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018); Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 703;
'08! The Senate ultimately accepted the House version ofthe bill, which excluded an omnibus clause. See United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369, 382-383 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (tracing history of the proposed omnibus provision in the witness-protection legislation). During the floor debate on thebill, Senator Heinz, one ofthe initiators and primary backersofthe legislation, explained that the omnibusclause was beyond the scope of the witness-protection measure at issue and likely "duplicative" of other obstruction laws, 128 Cong. Rec. 26,810 (1982) (Sen. Heinz), presumably referring to Sections 1503 and 1505.
1082 Tn a separate section addressing considerations uniqueto the presidency, we considerprinciples
of statutory construction relevant in that context. See VolumeII, Section III.B.1, infra. 165

US. Department of Justice Acttorney-WorkPreduet // Protected
Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 599-602. In several obstruction cases, the Court has imposed a nexus test that requires that the wrongful conducttargeted by the provision be sufficiently connectedto anofficial proceedingto ensure the requisite culpability. Marinello, 138 S, Ct. at 1109; Arthur Andersen, 544 US. at 707-708; Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600-602. Section 1512(c)(2) has been interpreted to require a similar nexus. See, e.g., United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v. Petruk, 781 F.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007). To satisfy the nexus requirement, the government must show as an objective matter that a defendant acted "én a mannerthatis likely to obstruct justice," such that the statute "excludes defendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably be successful." Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id. at 599 ("the endeavor must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice") (internal quotation marks omitted). The government must also show as a subjective matter that the actor "contemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding." Petruk, 781 F.3d at 445. Those requirementsalleviate fair-warning concerns by ensuring that obstructive conduct has a close enough connection to existing or future proceedings to implicate the dangers targeted by the obstruction laws and that the individual actually has the obstructive result in mind.
b. Courts also seek to construe statutes to avoid due process vagueness concerns. See, e.g., McDonnell y. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2373 (2016); Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 368, 402-404 (2010). Vagueness doctrine requires that a statute define a crime "with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conductis prohibited" and "in a mannerthat does not encouragearbitrary and discriminatory enforcement." Jd. at 402-403 (internal quotation marks omitted). The obstruction statutes' requirement of acting "corruptly" satisfies thattest.
"Acting `corruptly' within the meaning of § 1512(c)(2) means acting with an improper purpose and to engage in conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert, impedeor obstruct" the relevant proceeding. United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151 (10th Cir. 2013) (some quotation marks omitted). The majority opinion in Aguilar did not address the defendant's vagueness challenge to the word "corruptly," 515 U.S. at 600 n. 1, but Justice Scalia's separate opinion did reach that issue and would haverejected the challenge, id. at 616-617 (Scalia, J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). "Statutory language need not be colloquial," Justice Scalia explained, and "the term `corruptly' in criminal laws has a longstanding and well-accepted meaning. It denotes an act done with anintent to give some advantage inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others." Jd. at 616 (internal quotation marks omitted; citing lower court authority and legal dictionaries). Justice Scalia added that "in the context of obstructing jury proceedings, any claim of ignorance of wrongdoing is incredible." Jd. at 617. Lower courts have also rejected vagueness challenges to the word "corruptly." See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 869 F.3d 490, 501-502 (7th Cir. 2017); United States v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1280-1281 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d 1331, 1336 n.9 (Sth Cir. 1978). This well-established intent standard precludes the needto limit the obstruction statutes to only certain kinds of inherently wrongful conduct.!°8
1083 In United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the court of appeals found the term "corruptly" in 18 U.S.C. § 1505 vague as applied to a person who provided false information to Congress. After suggesting that the word "corruptly" was vague onits face, 951 F.2d at 378, the court
166

c. Finally, the rule of lenity does notjustify treating Section 1512(c)(2) as a prohibition on evidence impairment, as opposed to an omnibus clause. Therule of lenity is an interpretive principle that resolves ambiguity in criminal laws in favor of the less-severe construction. Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000). "[A]s [the Court has] repeatedly emphasized," however, the rule of lenity applies only if, "after considering text, structure, history and purpose, there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended." Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 188 n.10 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). The rule has been cited, for example, in adopting a narrow meaningof"tangible object" in an obstruction statute when the prohibition's title, history, andlist of prohibited acts indicated a focus on destruction of records. See Yates v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1074, 1088 (2015) (plurality opinion) (interpreting "tangible object" in the phrase "record, document, or tangible object" in 18 U.S.C. § 1519 to mean an item capable of recording or preserving information). Here, as discussed above, the text, structure, and history of Section 1512(c)(2) leaves no "grievous ambiguity" about the statute's meaning. Section 1512(c)(2) defines a structurally independent general prohibition on obstruction of official proceedings.
5. Other Obstruction Statutes Might Apply to the Conductin this Investigation Regardless whether Section 1512(c)(2) coversall corrupt acts that obstruct, influence, or impede pending or contemplated proceedings, other statutes would apply to such conduct in pending proceedings, provided that the remaining statutory elements are satisfied. As discussed above, the omnibus clause in 18 U.S.C. § 1503(a) applies generally to obstruction of pending
judicial and grand proceedings.! See Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 598 (noting that the clause is "far
more general in scope" than preceding provisions). Section 1503(a)'s protections extend to witness tampering and to other obstructive conduct that has a nexus to pending proceedings. See Sampson, 898 F.3d at 298-303 & n.6 (collecting cases from eight circuits holding that Section 1503 covers witness-related obstructive conduct, and cabining prior circuit authority). And Section 1505 broadly criminalizes obstructive conductaimed at pending agency and congressional
proceedings." See, e.g., United States v. Rainey, 757 F.3d 234, 241-247 (Sth Cir. 2014).
concluded that the statute did not clearly apply to corrupt conduct by the person himself and the "core" conduct to which Section 1505 could constitutionally be applied was onepersoninfluencing another person to violate a legal duty. Jd. at 379-386. Congress later enacted a provision overturning that result by providing that "[a]s used in [S]ection 1505, the term `corruptly' means acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing another, including by making false or misleading statement, or withholding, concealing,altering, or destroying a documentor other information." 18 U.S.C. § 1515(b). Other courts have declined to follow Poindexter either by limiting it to Section 1505 and the specific conductat issue in that case, see Brenson, 104 F.3d at 1280-1281; reading it as narrowly limited to certain types of conduct, see United States vy. Morrison, 98 F.3d 619, 629-630 (D.C. Cir. 1996); or by noting that it predated Arthur Andersen' s interpretation of the term "corruptly," see Edwards, 869F.3d at 501-502.
'984 Section 1503(a) provides for criminal punishmentof: Whoever . . . corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or
communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration ofjustice.

Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3) criminalizes tampering with witnesses to prevent the communication of information about a crime to law enforcement. The nexus inquiry articulated in Aguilar--that an individual has "knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding," 515 U.S. at 599--does not apply to Section 1512(b)(3). See United States v. Byrne, 435 F.3d 16, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2006). The nexus inquiry turns instead on the actor's intent to prevent communications to a federal law enforcementofficial. See Fowler v. United States, 563 U.S. 668, 673-678 (2011).

In sum, in light of the breadth of Section 1512(c)(2) and the other obstruction statutes, an argumentthat the conductat issue in this investigation falls outside the scope of the obstruction laws lacks merit.

B.

Constitutional Defenses to Applying Obstruction-Of-Justice Statutes to

Presidential Conduct

The President has broaddiscretion to direct criminal investigations. The Constitution vests the "executive Power"in the President and enjoins him to "take Care that the Lawsbe faithfully executed." U.S. Const. ARTII, §§ 1, 3. Those powers and duties form the foundation of prosecutorial discretion. See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (Attorney General and United States Attorneys"have this latitude because they are designated by statute as the President's delegates to help him discharge his constitutional responsibility to `take Care that the Lawsbe faithfully executed.'"), The President also has authority to appoint officers of the United States and to remove those whom hehas appointed. U.S. Const. ARTII, § 2, cl. 2 (granting authority to the President to appointall officers with the advice and consent of the Senate, but providing that Congress mayvest the appointmentofinferior officers in the President alone, the heads of departments, or the courts of law); see also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 492-493, 509 (2010) (describing removal authority as flowing from the President's "responsibility to take care that the lawsbe faithfully executed").

Although the President has broad authority under Article II, that authority coexists with Congress's Article I power to enact laws that protect congressional proceedings, federal investigations, the courts, and grand juries against corrupt efforts to underminetheir functions. Usually, those constitutional powers function in harmony, with the President enforcing the criminal laws underArticle IT to protect against corrupt obstructive acts. But when the President's official actions come into conflict with the prohibitions in the obstruction statutes, any constitutional tension is reconciled through separation-of-powersanalysis.

Whoevercorruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavorsto influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceedingis being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress.

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WerkPreduet // Proteeted-Under
The President's counsel has argued that "the President's exercise of his constitutional authority . . . to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations . . . cannot constitutionally
constitute obstruction of justice."'°8° As noted above, no Department of Justice position or
Supreme Court precedent directly resolved this issue. We did not find counsel's contention, however, to accord with our reading of the Supreme Court authority addressing separation-ofpowers issues. Applying the Court's framework for analysis, we concluded that Congress can validly regulate the President's exerciseofofficial duties to prohibit actions motivated by a corrupt intent to obstructjustice. The limited effect on presidential powerthatresults from thatrestriction would not impermissibly undermine the President's ability to perform his Article IT functions.
1. The Requirement of a Clear Statement _to Apply Statutes to Presidential Conduct Does Not Limit the Obstruction Statutes
Before addressing Article II issues directly, we consider one threshold statutoryconstruction principle that is unique to the presidency: "The principle that general statutes must be read as not applying to the President if they do not expressly apply where application would arguably limit the President's constitutional role." OLC, Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. 350, 352 (1995). This "clear statementrule," id., has its source in twoprinciples: statutes should be construedto avoid serious constitutional questions, and Congress should not be assumedto have altered the constitutional separation of powers without clear assurancethatit intended that result. OLC, The Constitutional Separation ofPowers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. O.L.C. 124, 178 (1996).
The Supreme Court has applied that clear-statementrule in several cases. In one leading case, the Court construed the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 ef seq., not to apply to judicial review ofpresidential action. Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-801 (1992). The Court explained that it "would require an express statement by Congress before assumingit intended the President's performanceof his statutory duties to be reviewedfor abuse of discretion." Id. at 801. In another case, the Court interpreted the word "utilized" in the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. App., to apply only to the use of advisory committees established directly or indirectly by the government, thereby excluding the American Bar Association's advice to the Departmentof Justice aboutfederal judicial candidates. Public Citizen vy. United States DepartmentofJustice, 491 U.S. 440, 455, 462-467 (1989). The Court explained that a broaderinterpretation of the term "utilized" in FACA would raise serious questions whether the statute "infringed unduly on the President's Article II power to nominate federal judges and violated the doctrine of separation of powers." Jd. at 466-467. Another case found that an established canonof statutory construction applied with "special force" to provisions that would impinge on the President's foreign-affairs powers if construed broadly. Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, 509 U.S. 155, 188 (1993) (applying the presumption against extraterritorial application to construe the Refugee Act of 1980 as not governing in an overseas context where it could affect "foreign and military affairs for which the President has unique responsibility"). See Application
1086 6/23/17 Letter, President's Personal Counsel to Special Counsel's Office, at 2 n. 1. 169

U.S. Departmentof Justice WorkPreduet // Preteeted
of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 353-354 (discussing Franklin, Public Citizen, and Sale).
The Departmentof Justice has relied on this clear-statement principle to interpret certain statutes as not applying to the Presidentatall, similar to the approach taken in Franklin. See, e.g., Memorandum for Richard T. Burress, Office of the President, from Laurence H. Silberman, Deputy Attorney General, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems Arising out of the President's Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28, 1974) (criminal conflict-of-interest statute, 18 U.S.C. § 208, does not apply to the President). Other OLC opinionsinterpret statutory text not to apply to certain presidential or executive actions because of constitutional concerns. See Application of28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments ofFederal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 350-357 (consanguinity limitations on court appointments, 28 U.S.C. § 458, found inapplicable to "presidential appointments of judges to the federal judiciary"); Constraints Imposed by 18 U.S.C. § 1913 on Lobbying Efforts, 13 Op. O.L.C. 300, 304-306 (1989) (limitation on the use of appropriated funds for certain lobbying programs foundinapplicable to certain communications by the President and executive officials).
But OLChasalso recognized that this clear-statement rule "does not apply with respect to a statute that raises no separation of powers questions wereit to be applied to the President," such as the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201. Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11. OLC explained that "[a]pplication of § 201 raises no separation of powers question, let alone a serious one," because [t]he Constitution confers no powerin the Presidentto receive bribes." /d. In support ofthat conclusion, OLCnoted constitutional provisions that forbid increases in the President's compensation while in office, "which is what a bribe would function to do," id. (citing U.S. Const. ART. II, § 1, cl. 7), and the express constitutional powerof "Congress to impeach [and convict] a Presidentfor, inter alia, bribery," id. (citing U.S. CONST. ARTII, § 4).
Under OLC's analysis, Congress can permissibly criminalize certain obstructive conduct by the President, such as suborning perjury, intimidating witnesses, or fabricating evidence, becausethose prohibitions raise no separation-of-powers questions. See Application of28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 nll. The Constitution does not authorize the President to engage in such conduct, and those actions would transgress the President's duty to "take Care that the Lawsbefaithfully executed." U.S. Const. ART II, §§ 3. In view of those clearly permissible applications of the obstruction statutes to the President, Franklin's holding that the President is entirely excluded from statute absenta clear statement would not apply in this context.
A morelimited application of a clear-statementrule to exclude from the obstruction statutes only certain acts by the President--for example, removing prosecutors or ending investigations for corrupt reasons--would be difficult to implement as a matter of statutory interpretation. It is not obvious how a clear-statement rule would apply to an omnibus provision like Section 1512(c)(2) to exclude corruptly motivated obstructive acts only whencarried outin the President's conductofoffice. No statutory term could easily bear that specialized meaning. For example, the word "corruptly" has a well-established meaning that does not exclude exercisesof official power for corrupt ends. Indeed, an established definition states that "corruptly" means action with an
170

U.S. Department ofJustice AttorteyWorkPredtet // Protected
intent to secure an improper advantage "inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others." BALLENTINE'S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed. 1969) (emphasis added). And it would be contrary to ordinary rules of statutory construction to adopt an unconventional meaningofa statutory term only when applied to the President. See United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (rejecting proposal to "giv[e] the same word,in the same statutory provision, different meanings in different factual contexts"); cf Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 462467 (giving the term "utilized" in the FACA a uniform meaningto avoid constitutional questions). Nor could such an exclusion draw on a separate and established background interpretive presumption, such as the presumption againstextraterritoriality applied in Sale. The principle that courts will construe a statute to avoid serious constitutional questions "is not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted bythe legislature." Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 59-60 (1997). "It is one thing to acknowledge and accept . . . well defined (or even newly enunciated), generally applicable, background principles of assumedlegislative intent. It is quite another to espouse the broad proposition that criminal statutes do not have to be read as broadly as they are written, but are subject to case-by-case exceptions." Brogan v. United States, 522 US. 398, 406 (1998).
Whena proposed construction "would thus function as an extra-textual limit on [a statute's] compass," thereby preventing the statute "from applying to a hostof cases falling within its clear terms," Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357, it is doubtful that the construction would reflect Congress's intent. That is particularly so with respect to obstruction statutes, which "have been given a broad and all-inclusive meaning." Rainey, 757 F.3d at 245 (discussing Sections 1503 and 1505) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, since no established principle of interpretation would exclude the presidential conduct we have investigated from statutes such as Sections 1503, 1505, 1512(b), and 1512(c)(2), we proceed to examine the separation-of-powers issues that could be raised as an Article II defense to the application of thosestatutes.
2. Separation-of-Powers Principles Support the Conclusion that Congress May Validly Prohibit Corrupt Obstructive Acts Carried Out Through the President's Official Powers
When Congress imposes a limitation on the exercise of Article IT powers, the limitation's validity depends on whetherthe measure"disrupts the balance between the coordinate branches." Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. 425, 443 (1977). "Even when branch does not arrogate powertoitself, . . . the separation-of-powersdoctrine requires that a branch not impair another in the performance of its constitutional duties." Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 757 (1996). The "separation of powers does not mean," however, "that the branches `ought to havenopartial agency in, or no controul overthe acts of each other.'" Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 703 (1997) (quoting James Madison, The Federalist No. 47, pp. 325-326(J. Cooke ed. 1961) (emphasis omitted)). In this context, a balancing test applies to assess separation-of-powersissues. Applying that test here, we concluded that Congress can validly make obstruction-of-justice statutes applicable to corruptly motivated official acts of the President without impermissibly undermining his Article Ifunctions.
171

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WorkPreduet // Protected
a. The Supreme Court's Separation-of-Powers Balancing Test Applies In This Context
A congressionally imposedlimitation on presidential action is assessed to determine "the extent to whichit prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishingits constitutionally assigned functions," and, if the "potential for disruption is present[,] . .. whether that impactis justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress." Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443; see Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731,753754 (1982); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 706-707 (1974). That balancingtest applies to a congressional regulation of presidential powerthrough the obstruction-of-justice laws. 108?
Whenan Article II power has notbeen "explicitly assigned by the text of the Constitution to be within the sole province of the President, but rather was thought to be encompassed within the general grant to the President of the `executive Power,'" the Court has balanced competing constitutional considerations. Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 484 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and O'Connor, J.). As Justice Kennedy noted in Public Citizen, the Court has applied a balancing test to restrictions on "the President's power to remove Executive officers, a power[that]. . . is not conferred by any explicit provision in the text of the Constitution (as is the appointment power), but rather is inferred to be a necessary part of the grant of the `executive Power.'" Jd. (citing Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 694 (1988), and Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 115-116 (1926)). Consistent with that statement, Morrison sustained a good-cause limitation on the removal of an inferior officer with defined prosecutorial responsibilities after determining that the limitation did not impermissibly undermine the President's ability to perform his Article II functions. 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696. The Court has also evaluated other general executive-powerclaims through a balancing test. For example, the Court evaluated the President's claim of an absoluteprivilege for presidential communications abouthis official acts by balancing thatinterest against the Judicial Branch's need for evidence in acriminal case. United States v. Nixon, supra (recognizing a qualified constitutional privilege for presidential communications onofficial matters). The Court has also upheld a law that provided for archival access to presidential records despite a claim of absolute presidential privilege over the records. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443-445, 451-455. The analysis in those cases supports applying a balancing test to assess the constitutionality of applying the obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential exercises of executive power.
Only in a few instanceshas the Court applied a different framework. When the President's poweris "both `exclusive' and `conclusive' on the issue," Congress is precluded from regulating its exercise. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2084 (2015). In Zivotofsky, for example, the Court followed "Justice Jackson's familiar tripartite framework" in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-638 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring), and held that the President's
1087 OLC applied such a balancing test in concluding that the President is not subject to criminal prosecution while in office, relying on many of the same precedents discussed in this section. See A Sitting
President's Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. 222, 237-238, 244-245 (2000) (relying on,inter alia, United States v. Nixon, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, and Clinton v. Jones, and quoting the legal standard from Administrator of General Services v. Nixon that is applied in the text), OLC recognized that "[t]he balancing analysis" it had initially relied on in finding that a sitting President is immunefrom prosécution had "been adopted as the appropriate mode ofanalysis by the Court." /d. at 244.
172

U.S. Departmentof Justice Werk // Proteeted
authority to recognize foreign nations is exclusive. Jd. at 2083, 2094. See also Public Citizen 491 U.S. at 485-486 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (citing the powerto grant pardons under U.S. Consr., ART. Il, § 2, cl. 1, and the Presentment Clausesfor legislation, U.S. CONST., ART. I, § 7, Cls. 2, 3, as examples ofexclusivepresidential powers by virtue of constitutional text).
But even when a poweris exclusive, "Congress' powers, andits central role in making laws, give it substantial authority regarding many of the policy determinations that precede and follow" the President's act. Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at 2087. For example, although the President's powerto grant pardons is exclusive and notsubject to congressional regulation, see United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 147-148 (1872), Congress has the authority to prohibit the corrupt use of"anything of value" to influence the testimony of anotherperson in a judicial, congressional, or agency proceeding, 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(3)--which would include the offer or promise of a pardon to induce'a person totestify falsely or not to testify at all. The offer of a pardon would precede the act of pardoning and thus be within Congress's powerto regulate even if the pardon itself is not. Just as the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 6, cl.1, absolutely protects legislative acts, but not a legislator's "taking or agreeing to take money for a promise to act in a certain way . . . for it is taking the bribe, not performanceoftheillicit compact, that is a criminal act," United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 526 (1972) (emphasis omitted), the promise of a pardon to corruptly influence testimony would not be a constitutionally immunized act. The application of obstruction statutes to such promises therefore would raise no serious separationof-powers issue.
b. The Effect of Obstruction-of-Justice Statutes on the President's Capacity to Perform His Article II Responsibilities is Limited
Under the Supreme Court's balancing test for analyzing separation-of-powers issues, the first task is to assess the degree to which applying obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential actions affects the President's ability to carry out his Article II responsibilities. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443. As discussed above, applying obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential conduct that does not involve the President's conduct of office--such as influencing the testimony of witnesses--is constitutionally unproblematic. The President has no more right than othercitizens to impedeofficial proceedings by corruptly influencing witness testimony. The conduct would be equally improper whether effectuated through direct efforts to produce false testimony or suppress the truth, or through the actual, threatened, or promised use ofofficial powersto achieve the same result.
The President's action in curtailing criminal investigations or prosecutions, or discharging law enforcementofficials, raises different questions. Each typeof action involves the exercise of executive discretion in furtherance of the President's duty to "take Care that the Lawsbefaithfully executed." U.S. Const., ART. II, § 3. Congress may not supplant the President's exercise of executive power to supervise prosecutions or to remove officers who occupy law enforcement positions. See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 726-727 (1986) ("Congress cannot reserve for itself the power of removal of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by impeachment. . . . [Becauset]he structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute the laws, . . . [t]his kind of congressional control over the execution of the laws . .°. is constitutionally impermissible."). Yet the obstruction-of-justice statutes do not aggrandize power in Congress or usurp executive authority. Instead, they impose a discrete limitation on conduct
173

U.S. Department ofJustice WorkPreduet // Protected
only whenit is taken with the "corrupt" intent to obstruct justice. The obstruction statutes thus would restrict presidential action only by prohibiting the President from acting to obstructofficial proceedings for the improper purpose of protecting his own interests. See Volume IIT, Section TIH.A.3, supra.
The direct effect on the President's freedom of action would correspondingly be a limited one. A preclusion of"corrupt" official action is not a major intrusion on Article II powers. For example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the Presidentto act with the intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such personal purposesfurthers, rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. And the Constitution does not mandate that the President have unfettered authority to direct investigations or prosecutions, with no limits whatsoever,in order to carry out his Article II functions. See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 833 (1985) ("Congress may limit an agency's exercise of enforcement powerif it wishes, either by setting substantive priorities, or by otherwise circumscribing an agency's powerto discriminate among issues or cases it will pursue."); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 707 ("[t]o read the Art. I] powers of the President as providing an absolute privilege [to withhold confidential communications from a criminal trial]... would upset the constitutional balance of `a workable government' and gravely impair the role of the courts underArt. IIT").
Nor must the President have unfettered authority to remove all Executive Branch officials involved in the execution of the laws. The Constitution establishes that Congress haslegislative authority to structure the Executive Branch by authorizing Congress to create executive departments and officer positions and to specify how inferior officers are appointed. E.g., U.S. Consr., ART. I, § 8, cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause); ART. II, § 2, cl. | (Opinions Clause); Art. II, § 2, cl. 2 (Appointments Clause); see Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 499. While the President's removal power is an important meansof ensuringthat officers faithfully execute the law, Congress has a recognized authority to place certain limits on removal. Id. at 493-495.
The President's removal powers are at their zenith with respectto principal officers--that is, officers who must be appointed by the President and whoreport to him directly. See Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493, 500. The President's "exclusive and illimitable power of removal" of those principal officers furthers "the President's ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed." Jd. at 493, 498 (internal quotation marks omitted); Myers, 272 U.S. at 627. Thus, "there are some `purely executive' officials who must be removable by the Presidentat will if he is able to accomplish his constitutional role." Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690; Myers, 272 U.S. at 134 (the President's "cabinet officers mustdo his will," and "[t]he momentthat he loses confidence in the intelligence, ability, judgment, or loyalty of any one of them, he must have the powerto remove him without delay"); cf Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935) (Congresshas the powerto create independent agencies headedby principal officers removable only for good cause). In light of those constitutional precedents, it may be that the obstruction statutes could not be constitutionally applied to limit the removalof a cabinet officer such as the Attorney General. See 5 U.S.C. § 101; 28 U.S.C. § 503. In that context, at least absent circumstances showing that the President was clearly attempting to thwart accountability for personal conduct while evading ordinary political checks and balances, even the highly limited
174

U.S. Department ofJustice Attorney-WerkPreduet // Protected
regulation imposed by the obstruction statutes could possibly intrude too deeply on the President's freedom to select and supervise the membersof his cabinet.
The removalof inferior officers, in contrast, need not necessarily beat will for the President to fulfill his constitutionally assignedrole in managing the Executive Branch. "[I]nferior officers are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by other officers appointed by the President with the Senate's consent." Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 510 (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 663 (1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted), The Supreme Court has long recognized Congress's authority to place for-cause limitations on the President's removal of "inferior Officers" whose appointment maybe vested in the head of a department. U.S. Const. ART. II, § 2, cl. 2. See United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886) ("The constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment[ofinferior officers in the heads of departments] implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may enactin relation to the officers so appointed") (quoting lower court decision);
Morrison, 487 US. at 689 n. 27 (citing Perkins); accordid. at 723-724 & n.4 (Scalia,J., dissenting) (recognizing that Perkins is "established" law); see also Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493495 (citing Perkins and Morrison). The category ofinferiorofficers includes both the FBI Director and the Special Counsel, each of whom reports to the Attorney General. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 509, 515(a), 531; 28 C.F.R. Part 600. Their work is thus "directed and supervised" by a presidentiallyappointed, Senate-confirmedofficer. See In re: Grand Jury Investigation, _ F.3d __, 2019 WL 921692, at *3-*4 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 26, 2019) (holding that the Special Counsel is an "inferior officer" for constitutional purposes).
Wherethe Constitution permits Congress to impose a good-causelimitation on the removal of an Executive Branch officer, the Constitution should equally permit Congress to bar removal for the corrupt purpose of obstructing justice. Limiting the.range of permissible reasons for removal to exclude a "corrupt" purpose imposesa lesser restraint on the President than requiring an affirmative showing of good cause. It follows that for such inferior officers, Congress may constitutionally restrict the President's removal authority if that authority was exercised for the corrupt purposeofobstructing justice. And evenif a particular inferior officer's position might be of such importance to the execution of the laws that the President must have at-will removal authority, the obstruction-of-justice statutes could still be constitutionally applied to forbid
removal for a corrupt reason.!°88 A narrow and discrete limitation on removal that precluded corrupt action would leave ample room forall other considerations, including disagreement over
policy or loss of confidence in the officer's judgment or commitment. A corrupt-purpose prohibition therefore would not undermine the President's ability to perform his Article II functions. Accordingly, because the separation-of-powers question is "whether the removal restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President's ability to perform his constitutional duty," Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691, a restriction on removing an inferiorofficer for a
1088 AIthough the FBIdirectoris an inferior officer, he is appointed by the President and removable by him at will, see 28 U.S.C. § 532 note,andit is not clear that Congress could constitutionally provide the FBI director with good-cause tenure protection. See OLC, Constitutionality of Legislation Extending the
Term ofthe FBI Director, 2011 WL 2566125, at *3 (O.L.C. June 20, 2011) ("tenure protection for an officer with the FBI Director's broad investigative, administrative, and policymaking responsibilities would raise a serious constitutional question whether Congress had `impede[d] the President's ability to perform his constitutional duty' to take care that the laws befaithfully executed") (quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691).
175

corrupt reason--a reason grounded in achieving personal rather than official ends--does not seriously hinder the President's performanceof his duties. The President retains broadlatitude to supervise investigations and remove officials, circumscribed in this context only by the
requirementthat he notact for corrupt personal purposes.'°
c. Congress Has Power to Protect Congressional, Grand Jury, and Judicial Proceedings Against Corrupt Acts from Any Source
Where a law imposes a burden on the President's performance of Article II functions, separation-of-powers analysis considers whether the statutory measure "is justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress." Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443. Here, Congress enacted the obstruction-ofjustice statutes to protect, among other things, the integrity of its own proceedings, grand jury investigations, and federal criminaltrials. Those objectives are within Congress's authority and serve strong governmental interests.
i. Congress has Article I authority to define generally applicable criminal law and apply it to all persons--including the President. Congress clearly has authority to protect its own legislative functions against corrupt efforts designed to impede legitimate fact-gathering and lawmaking efforts. See Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187, 206-207 (1957); Chapman v. United States, 5 App. D.C. 122, 130 (1895). Congress also has authority to establish a system of federal courts, which includes the powerto protect the judiciary against obstructive acts. See U.S. ConsT. ArT. I, § 8, cls. 9, 18 ("The Congress shall have Power . . . To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court" and "To makeall Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing powers"). The long lineage of the obstruction-of-justice
statutes, which can be traced to at least 1831, attests to the necessity for that protection. See An Act Declaratory of the Law Concerning Contempts ofCourt, 4 Stat. 487-488 § 2 (1831) (making it a crime if "any personor personsshall corruptly . . . endeavorto influence, intimidate, or impede any juror, witness, or officer, in any court of the United States, in the discharge of his duty, or shall, corruptly . . . obstruct, or impede, or endeavor to obstruct or impede, the due administration ofjustice therein").
ii. The Article III courts have an equally strong interest in being protected against obstructive acts, whatever their source. As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Nixon, a "primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch" is "to do justice in criminal prosecutions." 418 US. at 707; accord Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 384 (2004).

'089 The obstruction statutes do not disqualify the President from acting in a case simply because he has a personalinterest in it or because his own conduct may be at issue. As the DepartmentofJustice has madeclear, a claim ofa conflict of interest, standing alone, cannot deprive the Presidentof the ability to fulfill his constitutional function. See, e.g, OLC, Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments ofFederal Judges, 19 O.L.C. Op. at 356 (citing Memorandum for Richard T. Burress, Office of the President, from Laurence H. Silberman, Deputy Attorney General, Re: Conflict ofInterest Problems Arising out ofthe President's Nomination ofNelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty-
Fifth Amendmentto the Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28, 1974)).

relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due processof law and gravely impair the basic function of the courts." 407 U.S. at 712. As Nixon illustrates, the need to safeguardjudicial integrity is a compelling constitutional interest. See id. at 709 (noting that the denial of full disclosure of the facts surrounding relevant presidential communications threatens "(t]he very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system").

iii. Finally, the grand jury cannotachieve its constitutional purpose absentprotection from corrupt acts. Serious federal criminal charges generally reach the Article III courts based on an indictment issued by a grand jury. Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 327 (1940) ("The Constitution itself makes the grand jury a part of the judicial process."). And the grand jury's function is enshrinedin the Fifth Amendment. U.S. CONST. AMEND. V. ("[n]o person shall be held to answer" for a serious crime "unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury"). "[T]he whole theory of [the grand jury's] function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional government, serving as a kind of buffer or referee between the Government and the people," UnitedStates v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 47 (1992), "pledged to indict no one because ofprejudice and to free no one becauseof special favor." Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956). If the grand jury were not protected against corruptinterference from all persons, its function as an independent charging body would be thwarted. And an impartial grand jury investigation to determine whether probable causeexists to indict is vital to the criminal justice process.

The final step in the constitutional balancing process is to assess whether the separationof-powers doctrine permits Congress to take action within its constitutional authority notwithstanding the potential impact on Article II functions. See Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443; see also Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696; United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 711-712. In the case of the obstruction-of-justice statutes, our assessment of the weighing of interests leads us to conclude that Congress has the authority to impose the limited restrictions contained in those statutes on the President's official conduct to protect the integrity of important functions of other branches of government.
A general ban on corrupt action does not unduly intrude on the President's responsibility
to "take Carethat the Lawsbefaithfully executed." U.S. CONST. ARTIT, §§ 3.!°° To the contrary,
the conceptof "faithful execution" connotes the use of powerin the interest of the public, not in the office holder's personal interests. See 1 Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 763 (1755) ("faithfully" def. 3: "[w]ith strict adherence to duty and allegiance"). And immunizing the President from the generally applicable criminal prohibition against corrupt obstruction of official proceedings would seriously impair Congress's power to enact laws "to promote objectives within [its] constitutional authority," Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 425--i.e., protecting the integrity of its own proceedings and the proceedings of Article IIT courts and grand juries.

1099 As noted above, the President's selection and removalofprincipal executive officers may have a unique constitutional status.
177

Accordingly, based on the analysis above, we were not persuaded by the argumentthat the President has blanket constitutional immunity to engage in acts that would corruptly obstruct
justice through the exercise of otherwise-valid Article IT powers. '°!
3. Ascertaining Whether the President Violated the Obstruction Statutes Would Not Chill his Performance of his Article II Duties
Applying the obstruction statutes to the President's official conduct would involve determining as a factual matter whether he engaged in an obstructive act, whether the act had a nexus to official proceedings, and whether he was motivated by corrupt intent. But applying those standards to the President's official conduct should not hinder his ability to perform his Article IT duties. Cf Nixonv. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 752-753 & n.32 (taking into accountchilling effect on the President in adopting a constitutionalrule of presidential immunity from private civil damages action based on official duties). Several safeguards would prevent a chilling effect: the existence of settled legal standards, the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial actions, and the existence of evidentiary limitations on probing the President's motives. Andhistorical experience confirms that no impermissible chill should exist.
a. As an initial matter, the term "corruptly" sets a demanding standard. It requires a concrete showingthat a person acted with an intentto obtain an "improper advantage for [him]self or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others." BALLENTINE'S LAW DICTIONARY276 (3d ed. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F.3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That standard parallels the President's constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws. And virtually everything that the President does in the routine conduct of office will have a clear governmentalpurpose and will not be contrary to his official duty. Accordingly, the President has no reason to be chilled in those actions because, in virtually all instances, there will be no credible basis for suspecting a corrupt personal motive.
That point is illustrated by examples of conduct that would and would not satisfy the stringent corrupt-motive standard. Direct or indirect action by the President to end a criminal investigation into his own or his family members' conduct to protect against personal embarrassmentorlegalliability would constitute a core example of corruptly motivated conduct. So too would action to halt an enforcement proceeding that directly and adversely affected the President's financial interests for the purpose of protecting those interests. In those examples,
105! A possible remedy through impeachmentfor abuses of power wouldnot substitute for potential criminalliability after a President leaves office. Impeachment would remove a President from office, but would not address the underlying culpability of the conductor serve the usual purposesof the criminal law. Indeed, the Impeachment Judgment Clause recognizes that criminal law plays an independentrole in addressing an official's conduct, distinct from the political remedy of impeachment. See U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 3, cl. 7. Impeachmentis also a drastic and rarely invoked remedy, and Congress is not restricted to relying only on impeachment, rather than making criminal law applicable to a former President, as OLC has recognized. A Sitting President's Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. at 255 ("Recognizing an immunity from prosecution for a sitting President would not preclude such prosecution once the President's term is over or he is otherwise removed from office by resignation or impeachment.").
178

U.S. Department of Justice Atterney-WerkPreduet // Protected
official power is being used for the purpose of protecting the President's personal interests. In contrast, the President's actions to serve political or policy interests would not qualify as corrupt. The President's role as head of the government necessarily requires him to take into account political factors in making policy decisions that affect law-enforcementactions and proceedings. For instance, the President's decision to curtail a law-enforcement investigation to avoid international friction would not implicate the obstruction-of-justice statutes. The criminal law does not seek to regulate the consideration of such political or policy factors in the conduct of government. And whenlegitimate interests animate the President's conduct, those interests will almost invariably be readily identifiable based on objective factors. Because the President's conduct in those instances will obviously fall outside the zone of obstruction law, no chilling concern should arise.
b. There is also no reason to believe that investigations, let alone prosecutions, would occur except in highly unusual circumstances when a credible factual basis exists to believe that obstruction occurred. Prosecutorial action enjoys a presumption of regularity: absent "clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that [prosecutors] have properly discharged their official duties." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926)). The presumptionof prosecutorial regularity would provide even greater protection to the President than exists in routine cases given the prominence and sensitivity of any matter involving the President andthelikelihood that such matters will be subject to thorough and careful review at the most senior levels of the Departmentof Justice. Under OLC's opinion that a sitting President is entitled to immunity from indictment, only a successor Administration would be able to prosecute a former President. But that consideration does not suggest that a President would haveanybasis for fearing abusive investigations or prosecutions after leaving office. There are "obviouspolitical checks"againstinitiating a baseless investigation or prosecution of a former President. See Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 448 (considering political checks in separation-of-powers analysis). And the Attorney General holds "the power to conductthe criminal litigation of the United States Government," United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 694 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 516), which provides a strong institutional safeguard against politicized
investigations or prosecutions. !°
1092 Similar institutional safeguards protect Department of Justice officers and line prosecutors against unfounded investigations into prosecutorial acts. Prosecutors are generally barred from participating in matters implicating their personal interests, see 28 C.F.R. § 45.2, and are instructed not to be influenced by their "own professional or personal circumstances," Justice Manual § 9-27.260, so prosecutors would not frequently be in a position to take action that could be perceived as corrupt and personally motivated. And if such cases arise, criminal investigation would be conducted by responsible officials at the DepartmentofJustice, who can be presumedto refrain from pursuing an investigation absent a credible factual basis. Those facts distinguish the criminal context from the common-law rule of prosecutorial immunity, which protects against the threat of suit by "a defendant [who] often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions." Jmbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 425 (1976). As the Supreme Court has noted, the existence of civil immunity does notjustify criminal immunity. See O'Sheay, Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503 (1974) ("Whatever may be the case with respect to civil liability generally, .. . we have never held that the performance ofthe duties
of judicial, legislative, or executive officers, requires or contemplates the immunization of otherwise criminaldeprivation ofconstitutional rights.") (citations omitted).
179

U.S. Department of Justice WerkPreduet // Protected
These considerations distinguish the Supreme Court's holding in Nixon v. Fitzgerald that, in part because inquiries into the President's motives wouldbe "highly intrusive," the Presidentis absolutely immunefrom private civil damagesactions based onhis official conduct. 457 U.S. at 756-757. As Fitzgerald recognized, "there is a lesser public interest in actions for civil damages than, for example, in criminal prosecutions." Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 754 n.37; see Cheney, 542 U.S. at 384. Andprivate actions are not subjectto the institutional protections of an action under the supervision of the Attorney General and subject to a presumption of regularity. Armstrong, 517 US. at 464.
c. In the rare cases in which a substantial and credible basis justifies conducting an investigation of the President, the process of examining his motivations to determine whether he acted for a corrupt purpose need not have a chilling effect. Ascertaining the President's motivations would turn on any explanation he provided to justify his actions, the advice he received, the circumstances surrounding the actions, and the regularity or irregularity of the process he employed to make decisions. But grand juries and courts would not have automatic access to confidential presidential communications on those matters; rather, they could be presented in official proceedings only on a showingof sufficient need. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 712; In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 754, 756-757 (D.C. Cir. 1997); see also Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 448-449 (former President can invoke presidential communications privilege, although successor's failure to support the claim "detracts from [its] weight').
In any event, probing the President's intent in a criminal matter is unquestionably constitutional in at least one context: the offense of bribery turns on the corrupt intent to receive a thing of value in return for being influencedin official action. 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(2). There can be no serious argument against the President's potential criminal liability for bribery offenses, notwithstanding the need to ascertain his purpose and intent. See U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 3; ART. II, § 4; see also Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11 ("Application of § 201[to the President] raises no separation of powers issue, let alone a serious one."').
d. Finally, history provides no reason to believe that any asserted chilling effect justifies exempting the President from the obstruction laws. As a historical matter, Presidents have very seldom been the subjects of grand jury investigations. And it is rarer still for circumstances to raise even the possibility of a corrupt personal motive for arguably obstructive action throughthe President's use of official power. Accordingly, the President's conduct of office should not be chilled based on hypothetical concerns aboutthe possible application of a corrupt-motive standard in this context.
In sum, contrary to the position taken by the President's counsel, we concluded that, in light of the Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues, we had a valid basis for investigating the conductat issue in this report. In our view, the application of the obstruction statutes would not impermissibly burden the President's performance of his Article II function to supervise prosecutorial conduct or to remove inferior law-enforcement officers. And the protection of the criminal justice system from corrupt acts by any person--including the President--accords with the fundamental principle of our government that "[n]Jo [person] in this

181

U.S. Departmentof Justice Attorney-WorkPreduet // Protected IV. CONCLUSION
Because we determined not to makea traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct. The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction ofjustice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.

Wefirst explain the process that led to the submission of written questions and then attach the President's responses. Beginning in December 2017, this Office sought for more than a year to interview the President on topics relevant to both Russian-election interference and obstruction-of-justice. We advised counsel that the President was a "subject" of the investigation underthe definition of the Justice Manual--"a person whoseconductis within the scope of the grand jury's investigation." Justice Manual § 9-11.151 (2018). We also advised counselthat "[a]n interview with the President is vital to our investigation" and that this Office had "carefully considered the constitutional and other argumentsraised by... counsel, and they d[id] not provide us with reason to forgo seeking an interview."! We additionally stated that "it is in the interest of the Presidency and the public for an interview to take place" and offered "numerous accommodationsto aid the President's preparation andavoid surprise." After extensive discussions with the DepartmentofJustice about the Special Counsel's objective of securing the President's testimony, these accommodations included the submissionsof written questions to the President on certain Russia-related topics.? Wereceivedthe President's written responsesin late November 2018.' In December 2018, weinformed counselofthe insufficiency of those responsesin several respects.° We noted, among other things, that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he "does not `recall' or `remember' or have an `independentrecollection'" of information called for by the questions.° Other answers were "incomplete or imprecise."" The written responses, we informed counsel, "demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask followup questions that would ensure complete answersandpotentially refresh your client's recollection or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection."® We again requested an in-person interview, limited to certain topics, advising the President's counsel that "[t]his is the President's

Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whetherto issue a subpoenaforhis testimony. We viewed the written answers to be inadequate. Butat that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report. We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutionallitigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report. As explained in Volume Il, Section II.B., we determined that the substantial quantity of information wehad obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant factual conclusionson intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation.

Response to Question I, Parts (a) through (c)
I have norecollection of learning at the time that Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner wasconsidering participating in a meeting in June 2016 concerning potentially negative information about Hillary Clinton. Nor do I recall learning during the campaign that the June 9, 2016 meeting had takenplace, that the referenced emails existed, or that Donald J. Trump, Jr., had other communications with Emin Agalarov or Robert Goldstone between June 3, 2016 and June 9, 2016.

Response to Question I, Part (d) I have no independentrecollection of what portion of these four days in June of 2016 I spent in Trump Tower. This was one of many busy months during a fast-paced campaign, as the primary season was ending and we werepreparing for the general election campaign. I am now aware that my Campaign's calendarindicates that | was in New York City from June 6
--9, 2016. Calendars kept in my Trump Toweroffice reflect that I had variouscalls and meetings scheduled for each of these days. While those calls and meetings may or may notactually have
taken place, they do indicate that I was in Trump Towerduring a portion of each of these working days, and I have no reason to doubt that [ was. When | was in NewYork City, I stayed at my Trump Towerapartment. My Trump Organization desk calendar also reflects that | was outside Trump Tower during portions of these days. The June 7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave Trump Tower in the early evening for Westchester where I gave remarks after winning the California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries held that day. The June 8, 2016 calendar indicates a scheduled departure in late afternoon to attend a ceremony at my son's school. The June 9, 2016 calendar indicates | was scheduled to attend midday meetings and a fundraising luncheonat the Four Seasons Hotel. At this point, | do not remember on what dates these events occurred, but I do not currently have a reason to doubt that they took place as scheduled on my calendar. Widely available media reports, including television footage, also shed light on my activities during these days. For example, | am aware that my June 7, 2016 victory remarks at the Trump

U.S. Department of Justice Work // PrMay-Co ontaitMateriettect Fed Re -Crim P6d fe) National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, New York, were recorded and published by the media.| remember winning those primaries and generally recall delivering remarks that evening. At this point in time, I do not remember whether I spoke or met with Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushneron June 9, 2016. My desk calendar indicates | was scheduled to meet with Paul Manafort on the morning of June 9, but I do not recall if that meeting took place. It was more than twoyears ago,at a time when | had many calls and interactionsdaily. Response to Question I, Part (e) I have no independent recollection of any communications | had with the Agalarov family or anyone I understood to be a representative of the Agalarov family after June 3, 2016 and before the end of the campaign. While preparing to respond to these questions, I have become aware of written communications with the Agalarovs during the campaign that were sent, received, and largely authored by my staff and which I understand have already been produced to you. In general, the documents include congratulatory letters on my campaign victories, emails about a painting Emin and Aras Agalarov arranged to have delivered to Trump Toweras a birthday present, and emails regarding delivery of a book written by Aras Agalarov. The documentsreflect that the deliveries were screened by the SecretService. Response to Question I, Part(f) I do not recall being aware during the campaign of communications between Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner and any memberor representative of the Agalarov family, Robert Goldstone, Natalia Veselnitskaya (whose name | wasnot familiar with), or anyone I understood to be a Russianofficial. Response to QuestionI, Part (g) In remarks [ delivered the night I won the California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries, I said, "I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we're goingto be discussingall of the things that have taken place with the Clintons." In general, I expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available, negative information about the Clintons, including, for example, Mrs. Clinton's failed policies, the Clintons' use of the State Department to further their interests and the interests of the Clinton Foundation, Mrs. Clinton's improper use of a private server for State Department business, the destruction of 33,000 emails on that server, and Mrs. Clinton's temperamental unsuitability for the office of President. In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the Campaign documentsalready producedto youreflect the drafting, evolution, and sources of information for the speech I expected to give "probably" on the Monday following my June 7, 2016 comments. These documents generally show that the text of the speech wasinitially drafted by Campaign staff
C-14

U.S. Departmentof Justice AttorneyWork // PrMay-Contei oMaterialtecnder t Fed Re -Crim-P-6fd e)
with input from various outside advisors and was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer.
The Pulse Nightclub terrorist attack took place in the early morning hours of Sunday, June 12, 2016. In light of that tragedy, I gave a speechdirected more specifically to national security and terrorism than to the Clintons. That speech wasdelivered at the Saint Anselm College Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire, and, as reported, opened with the following:
This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be. Even her former Secret Service Agent, who hasseen her underpressure and in times of stress, hasstated that she lacks the temperamentand integrity to be president. There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issuesat a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon. But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.
[ continued to speak about Mrs. Clinton's failings throughout the campaign, using the information preparedforinclusion in the speech to which I referred on June 7, 2016.

Response to QuestionI, Part (h) I have no recollection of being told during the campaign that Vladimir Putin or the Russian government "supported" my candidacy or "opposed"the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. However, I was aware of somereports indicating that President Putin had made complimentary statements about me.

Response to QuestionI, Part(i) I have norecollection of being told during the campaign that any foreign governmentor foreign leader had provided, wished to provide, or offered to provide tangible support to my campaign.

SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE TRANSFERRED, REFERRED, AND COMPLETED CASES This appendix identifies matters transferred or referred by the Special Counsel's Office, as well as cases prosecuted by the Office that are now completed.

A. Transfers The Special Counsel's Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination
between the Russian governmentandindividuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain matters assigned to the Office by the Acting Attorney General havenot fully concluded as of the

things, possible criminal conduct by Michael Flynn in acting as an unregistered agent for the

Governmentof Turkey. See August 2, 2017 Memorandum from Mueller, III. The Acting Attorney General later confirmed the investigate Rafiekian and Alptekin because they "may have been
