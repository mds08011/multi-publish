## Features

- high fidelity text; not deteriorated by photocopy, redaction, and optical character recognition
- available in PDF and ePub formats
- supports full-text search
- split document into Volume 1 and Volume 2
- PDF page numbering matches content page numbering
- descriptive page headers with section name
- working hyperlinks for table of contents and footnotes
- redactions are represented explicitly in the source code
- reduced file size (under 5 MB)
- canonical URL with greater permanence than DOJ distribution

### Limitations

- *under development; not complete yet*
- might include typos and other errors; [please help if you find anything!](https://github.com/iandennismiller/mueller-report/blob/master/Contributing.md#contributing)
- page numbers do not correspond to original Mueller document or to DOJ release
- redacted boxes are interrupted by spaces; they are not continuous
- redacted boxes, which are based on lorem ipsum text, are suggestive of underlying word length and structure although no information about this is known
- other cosmetic differences

## Motivation

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a redacted version of the Mueller Report on April 18, 2019.
The DOJ release suffers from [technical limitations that interfere with public discussion](https://www.pdfa.org/a-technical-and-cultural-assessment-of-the-mueller-report-pdf/) about the Mueller investigation.
For example:

- [the DOJ PDF cannot be searched](https://www.pdfa.org/even-with-ocr-the-mueller-report-pdf-isnt-fully-searchable/)
- passages of text in the DOJ PDF cannot be highlighted or copied-and-pasted
- the table of contents in the DOJ PDF is not "clickable"
- the page numbers in the footer do not match the DOJ PDF page numbers
- the DOJ PDF appears to be derived from an optically-scanned copy and, consequently, there are visual artifacts in the PDF
- the DOJ PDF is a large file (137 MB)

[Open Source Mueller Report](https://github.com/iandennismiller/mueller-report) is an effort to correct those technical limitations by providing a "clean room" reimplementation of the document from source code.
